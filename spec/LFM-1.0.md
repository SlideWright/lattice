# LFM 1.0 — Lattice-Flavored Markdown

**Version:** 1.0-draft (pre-ratification) · **Status:** Draft · **Date:** 2026-06-13
**License:** [CC-BY-4.0](#12-governance--license)

LFM (Lattice-Flavored Markdown) is the authoring dialect of the
[Lattice](../README.md) slide engine. Its name follows *GitHub-Flavored
Markdown*: LFM is **a profile of Markdown, not a new language.**

> **LFM = CommonMark + GFM task lists + the Lattice extension set.**

A document written in LFM is a valid Markdown document. Every LFM extension
MUST render readably in a CommonMark viewer that has **no knowledge of
Lattice** — GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Confluence included. That property is
**graceful degradation**, the governing rule of the standard and the criterion
for adopting any future extension (§5).

This document specifies what LFM adds to Markdown, how each addition degrades,
and what makes a document *conformant*. It does not specify a parser: LFM rides
CommonMark, and any conformant CommonMark/GFM parser plus the extension handlers
below is a conformant LFM implementation.

---

## 1. Conformance levels

LFM defines three levels so a tool can advertise precisely what it supports.

| Level | Name | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| **L0** | *Markdown-faithful* | The document is valid CommonMark + GFM. An LFM-unaware renderer produces a readable result. **Every conformant LFM document is L0.** |
| **L1** | *Lattice-structured* | The renderer understands the **slide** and **block** extensions (§2–§3): `_class` directives, front-matter directives, the card grammar, and state markers. It produces Lattice layouts. |
| **L2** | *Lattice-diagnostic* | The tool additionally implements the [Diagnostic Protocol](./diagnostics.md): it validates a document, reports findings with stable rule IDs, and offers machine-applicable fixes. |

A **conformant LFM document** is valid at L0 and follows the grammar in §2–§4
for every Lattice construct it uses. A **conformant LFM renderer** declares the
highest level it implements.

## 2. Slide-level extensions

### 2.1 The `_class` directive

A slide selects a Lattice component with a Marpit class directive — an **HTML
comment**, so it is invisible in every Markdown renderer:

```markdown
<!-- _class: split-compare -->
```

The value is a space-separated list of one **component name** plus zero or more
**modifier tokens** (§4). The complete, machine-readable vocabulary of names,
modifiers, slots, and skeletons is published in
[`dist/docs/grammar.json`](../dist/docs/grammar.json), generated from the
component manifests.

- **Degrades to:** nothing visible (HTML comment). **L0-clean.**

### 2.2 Slide separators

Slides are separated by a thematic break on its own line (`---`). This is
CommonMark `<hr>`; an unaware renderer shows horizontal rules between sections.

- **Degrades to:** horizontal rules. **L0-clean.**

### 2.3 Front-matter directives

A leading YAML front-matter block carries deck-wide directives. LFM recognises,
in addition to Marpit's own (`theme`, `paginate`, `_class`, …):

| Key | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `finish:` | `boardroom` \| `sketch` \| `sketch-clean` | Deck-wide visual register. Unknown values are a diagnostic (§ `unknown-finish`). |
| `logo:` | path | Deck logo injected into the masthead. |

These two keys are the complete LFM-added front-matter surface in 1.0; every
other recognised key belongs to Marpit.

- **Degrades to:** front matter is hidden or shown as a metadata table,
  depending on the host. **L0-clean** (it is YAML front matter, which every
  GFM host already special-cases).

## 3. Block-level extensions

### 3.1 The card grammar (nested-list slots)

Card-style and ledger layouts read a **title + body** from a nested list (a
*card-style* layout is one whose grammar declares a card slot; the set is
published in [`dist/docs/grammar.json`](../dist/docs/grammar.json)). The
canonical shape is:

```markdown
- Title
  - body text
```

The inline form `- **Title.** body` is **not** valid LFM on a card-style
layout: the body inherits the title's weight. This is enforced as a diagnostic
(`card-style-inline-title`, with an autofix). Ledger/numbered layouts use the
ordered form:

```markdown
1. Name
   - body text
```

- **Degrades to:** a nested bullet list — exactly what it reads as. **L0-clean.**

### 3.2 State markers

A single-character marker at the start of a list item encodes a status. The
grammar is **shared** across `checklist`, `verdict-grid`, `obligation-matrix`,
`roadmap`, and `pricing`:

| Marker | Semantic | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | pass / done / met | GFM task-list syntax. |
| `[ ]` | neutral *or* not-met | Context-dependent: *todo/planned/exempt* in checklist/roadmap/obligation-matrix; *not-met* in verdict-grid. GFM task-list syntax. |
| `[-]` | partial / warn | **Not GFM syntax** (see §5.1). |
| `[/]` | skip / out-of-scope | **Not GFM syntax** (see §5.1). |

- **`[x]` / `[ ]` degrade to:** real checkboxes in any GFM host. **L0-clean.**
- **`[-]` / `[/]` degrade to:** literal text (`[-] …`). Readable but not a
  checkbox — LFM 1.0's only non-GFM-clean construct (§5.1).

### 3.3 Fenced sub-languages (charts & diagrams)

A fenced code block with a recognised info string is a **sub-language**. Each
is its own mini-spec; LFM only requires that it degrades to a code block.

| Info string | Sub-language | Degrades to |
|---|---|---|
| `functionplot` | A [function-plot](https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/) graph spec (JSON body: mathematical functions + axes). Used today by the `math` component's `canvas` variant to draw a curve beside an equation. | A code block showing the JSON config. **L0-clean.** |
| `mermaid` | Mermaid (passthrough), used by the `diagram` component. | A code block. **L0-clean** (and Mermaid-aware hosts render the diagram). |

Each fence is **named after the library that renders it**: `functionplot` for
function-plot, `mermaid` for Mermaid. This matches how the equation half of the
`math` component uses standard `$$…$$` to pass through to KaTeX. LFM does
**not** rebrand these libraries or claim to own their config languages.

What LFM owns is narrow and consistent across all three: the fence
registration, the SVG **theming** that makes the output inherit the deck's
palette tokens, and the **degradation contract**. The fence body is the
renderer library's own configuration language, not Markdown, and LFM does not
own its schema. [`dist/docs/grammar.json`](../dist/docs/grammar.json) records
each fence's library, component, and deprecated aliases; the config schema stays
with that library, so this prose spec stays stable as those options evolve.

> **Deprecated alias.** The `functionplot` fence was previously named
> `latticeplot`. That name implied a Lattice-owned grammar that does not exist
> (the body is function-plot's, verbatim), so it was renamed for honesty.
> ```` ```latticeplot ```` is accepted as a **deprecated alias for one release**
> and will be removed in a future major version. See the
> `2026-06-13-lfm-standard` decision note.

### 3.4 Other inline conventions

- **Eyebrow / subtitle / hero number** and similar slot conventions are
  ordinary Markdown (a leading inline-code span, an `<em>`-wrapped unit, an
  `<h2>` lifted into a panel). They are structural reads over standard Markdown,
  documented per component in `grammar.json`, and are **L0-clean** by
  construction.

### 3.5 Speaker notes

An **HTML comment on a slide that is neither a directive nor a tooling pragma**
is that slide's speaker note. This is Marp's own semantics, unchanged:

```markdown
# The slide title

<!-- Open cold. Pause two seconds before the first word. -->
```

A slide may carry several note comments; they are concatenated in order. Two
comment kinds are **not** notes, matching Marpit exactly:

- **Directives** — `<!-- _class: … -->`, `<!-- paginate: true -->`, and any
  comment that parses as a block of known directive keys (§2.1, §2.3).
- **Tooling pragmas** — `markdownlint-*`, `prettier-ignore[-start|-end]`, and
  `lint disable|enable|ignore …` (the editor/formatter control comments). The
  recognised set is Marpit's `magicCommentMatchers`, mirrored in the reference
  implementation `lib/authoring/notes-core.js` so every render path agrees on
  the note/non-note boundary.

A conformant L1 renderer SHOULD surface notes through whatever presenter channel
it offers. How a note is *presented* is implementation-defined; *what counts as a
note* is the contract above, and that boundary is what conformance fixes. Among
the reference render paths today, **Lattice's emulator** materialises notes — a
per-page PDF text annotation plus a hidden `aside.lattice-notes` element in the
HTML sidecar; under marp-cli the same comments are marp-core's native notes
(surfaced by `marp --pdf-notes` or a PPTX export); the VS Code preview does not
surface them yet. All three draw the note/non-note line identically.

- **Degrades to:** nothing visible — an HTML comment is invisible in every
  Markdown renderer, and on GitHub/GitLab a comment is already how an author
  leaves an out-of-band remark. **L0-clean.**

## 4. The component & modifier vocabulary

`_class` tokens are one **component name** plus modifier tokens. The full list
is generated, not enumerated here, so it cannot drift:

- **Component names** — `dist/docs/components.json` (`vocabularies.buckets` and
  the per-component entries) and the human catalog `dist/docs/components.md`.
- **Per-component grammar** — `dist/docs/grammar.json`: for each component, its
  `_class` token, its required and optional **slots** (CSS selector +
  description), its **skeleton**, and the **fences/state-markers** it reads.
- **Modifiers** — recognised by set membership or by these prefix families:
  `tint-`, `mark-`, `with-`, `at-`, `no-`, `tone-`, `treatment-`, `checks-`,
  plus the universal/semi-universal variant sets. The authoritative prefix list
  is `MODIFIER_PREFIXES` in
  [`lib/authoring/lint-core.js`](../lib/authoring/lint-core.js); the enumerated
  variant tiers are catalogued in
  [`design/design-system.md`](../design/design-system.md) §6.5.

An unrecognised token is a diagnostic (`unknown-class`) with a did-you-mean
suggestion, never a hard parse error — an LFM document with a typo is still a
valid Markdown document.

## 5. Graceful degradation — the governing rule

**Every LFM extension MUST render as readable Markdown in an LFM-unaware
renderer.** This is the property that makes LFM safe for a host like GitHub to
render, and safe for an author to write without lock-in.

**Rule for future extensions:** no construct may be added to LFM without a row
in the degradation table (§2–§3) stating exactly what an unaware renderer
shows. If a construct cannot degrade readably, it is rejected or redesigned.

### 5.1 Known non-GFM-clean constructs

LFM 1.0 has exactly one: the **`[-]` and `[/]` state markers** (§3.2). GFM
task-list syntax covers only `[x]` and `[ ]`, so `[-]`/`[/]` render as literal
text in a vanilla GFM host. They are retained because the four-state grammar is
load-bearing across five components and the literal-text fallback is readable.
A future LFM version MAY introduce GFM-clean aliases. Until then, this is a
documented exception, not a conformance failure.

## 6. Relationship to other standards

- **CommonMark** — LFM is a strict superset. Every CommonMark document is a
  valid (if Lattice-inert) LFM document.
- **GFM** — LFM adopts GFM task lists and tables. The only divergence is §5.1.
- **Marpit / Marp** — LFM's slide model (`_class`, `---` separators, front
  matter) is Marpit-compatible; Lattice is a Marp-based engine. Marpit gives
  you slides and a directive syntax; LFM adds what Marpit does not specify — a
  named, versioned, conformance-levelled contract, the degradation guarantee
  (§5), a fixed component/modifier vocabulary (§4), and a stable diagnostic
  protocol. LFM names and constrains the subset that produces boardroom layouts.
- **Mermaid** — embedded as a fenced sub-language (§3.3), unchanged.

## 7. Versioning

LFM follows SemVer at the *standard* level, tracking the engine's stability
contract: layouts and tokens are stable surfaces (see `CHANGELOG.md`).

- **Major** — removing or breaking an extension, or breaking degradation.
- **Minor** — adding an extension (with its degradation row) or a component.
- **Patch** — clarifications and editorial fixes.

The machine-readable surface (`grammar.json`, `components.json`) is regenerated
from the manifests on every build, so it always matches the engine that ships
alongside this document.

## 8. Conformance testing

Conformance is verifiable at each level, with a distinct test shape per level:

- **L0 (degradation).** A fixture pairs an LFM source fragment with the readable
  Markdown a Lattice-unaware renderer MUST produce. The degradation rows in
  §2–§3 are the normative seed for this corpus.
- **L1 (structure).** A fixture pairs an LFM document with the components and
  slots a renderer MUST resolve from it — the `_class` token, the card-grammar
  reads, the state-marker semantics. The per-component grammar in
  [`dist/docs/grammar.json`](../dist/docs/grammar.json) is the oracle.
- **L2 (diagnostics).** A fixture pairs an LFM document with the exact set of
  findings (diagnostics §1) a tool MUST emit: rule ID, severity, slide, and any
  autofix result. The reference implementation's lint fixtures are the seed and
  its output is the v1 oracle.

A formal, runnable conformance suite is **forthcoming** — step 2 of the adoption
path in the `2026-06-13-lfm-standard` decision note. Until it ships, the
degradation tables in §2–§3 and the reference implementation's fixtures are the
conformance contract.

## 9. Security considerations

LFM itself executes nothing: the prose layer is CommonMark, and every extension
degrades to valid Markdown. The security surface is the fenced **sub-languages a
host renders** (§3.3): Mermaid and function-plot both produce SVG from
author-supplied configuration. A host that renders untrusted LFM MUST treat
them as it treats any embedded renderer.

- **Sanitise the rendered SVG.** Strip scripts, foreign objects, and event
  handlers before inlining the output — exactly as a host already does for a
  `mermaid` block.
- **Bound the work.** A fence body is attacker-controllable. A host SHOULD cap
  render time and output size to resist denial-of-service from a pathological
  config.
- **Resolve asset paths under the host's policy.** The `logo:` directive (§2.3)
  and any local-file reference resolve against the host's asset policy, not
  LFM's; a host MUST NOT widen its file-access surface to render LFM. The
  Lattice reference engine gates local files behind an explicit
  `--allow-local-files` flag.

## 10. Adding to the vocabulary

The component, modifier, and fence vocabulary is **closed to the manifest set**
in LFM 1.0: a third party cannot register a new `_class` component, modifier
prefix, or fence into the standard at authoring time. New vocabulary enters LFM
the way every current entry did — a component manifest (or a fence
registration) is added to the engine, and the build projects it into
`grammar.json`, so the published grammar and the linter vocabulary update
together and cannot drift (§4).

An unrecognised token is therefore a diagnostic (`unknown-class`), never a parse
error: an author who reaches for vocabulary that does not exist is warned, not
blocked. A registration path for out-of-tree vocabulary — an org-private
modifier family, a third-party fence such as `vega-lite` — is deferred (§11).

## 11. Non-goals (LFM 1.0)

LFM 1.0 deliberately does **not**:

- **Define a parser or a formal grammar (ABNF/EBNF) for the prose layer.** LFM
  rides CommonMark; the parser is CommonMark's. `grammar.json` is a structural
  projection (selectors + skeletons), not a parser grammar.
- **Re-encode the `[-]` / `[/]` state markers** into GFM-clean glyphs (§5.1).
  The current glyphs are documented, not changed, in 1.0.
- **Open a registration path** for out-of-tree components, modifiers, or fences
  (§10).
- **Ship a Language Server or character-precise diagnostic ranges.** The
  diagnostic protocol is their foundation; see diagnostics §6.

## 12. Governance & license

- **License.** This specification — the prose under `spec/` — is published under
  **[CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**. Anyone may
  implement LFM (a renderer, a linter, a `remark` plugin) and redistribute the
  spec, with attribution. The Lattice engine's *code* is MIT; the spec carries
  its own license because a normative document is a different artifact from the
  reference implementation.
- **Steward.** The SlideWright project stewards LFM. The spec is the owned
  asset; conformant implementations are interchangeable, and a second
  implementation is an explicit adoption goal.
- **Amendments.** Changes follow the SemVer rules in §7 and land through the
  project's normal review — a PR against `spec/`, recorded in the history below
  and in `CHANGELOG.md`. Any change to a normative MUST/MAY requires a version
  bump per §7.

## Appendix A — A worked example (informative)

A three-slide LFM deck, and how the same source reads in each environment:

````markdown

theme: indaco

<!-- _class: title -->

# Q3 Strategy

`Board review · 2026-06-13`

How we get to plan by year-end.

<!-- _class: cards-grid -->

## Bets

- Expand EU
  - Two markets live by Q4.

  - Private beta with six design partners.
````

**In a Lattice-unaware viewer (GitHub, plain CommonMark):**

- The front matter is hidden or shown as a metadata table.
- The `_class` comments are invisible.
- `---` renders as horizontal rules between sections.
- `[x]` and `[ ]` render as real checkboxes; `[-]` renders as the literal text
  `[-]` (§5.1).
- The eyebrow code-span and the "Bets" nested list render as ordinary inline
  code and a nested bullet list.

A reviewer on GitHub sees a titled, sectioned checklist and a list of bets — the
document is **completely readable** with no Lattice support.

**In Lattice (L1+):**

- Slide 1 renders the `title` component: display headline, eyebrow, standfirst.
- Slide 2 renders `checklist`, mapping `[x]` / `[-]` / `[ ]` to pass / partial /
  todo states.
- Slide 3 renders `cards-grid`, lifting each card's first line to a bold title
  above its body.

Nothing in the source is lost on the way down, and nothing Lattice-specific
leaks up into the degraded view.

*This spec is generated-adjacent: `tools/build-docs-portal.js` builds the
vocabulary and per-component grammar it points to (`dist/docs/grammar.json`,
`dist/docs/components.json`) from the component manifests. This prose is the
stable contract; the machine artifacts are the always-current detail.*
