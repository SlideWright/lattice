/**
 * composed-contrast — WCAG audit of the surfaces a COMPONENT composes, not the
 * pairs a palette declares.
 *
 * Complements tools/contrast-audit.js rather than duplicating it (HARD RULE #15).
 * That tool scores each theme's own token matrix: an ink against `--bg` and
 * `--bg-alt`, the two opaque canvases a palette names. It structurally cannot see
 * the surface a component INVENTS by stacking paints — and this engine's status
 * ink is almost never on a bare canvas:
 *
 *   · `redline` paints `<ins>` / `<del>` on `--pass-bg` / `--fail-bg`, which is a
 *     12% tint OF THE SAME TOKEN. The background MOVES WITH THE INK, so a curated
 *     hue can be re-tuned and gain nothing.
 *   · its `.split` / `.stacked` / `.three-col` cards put that band on ANOTHER
 *     own-hue tint (4–5% over `--bg-alt`), two own-hue layers deep.
 *   · `word-cloud spectrum` paints `--seq-700/500/400` — stops the BASE derives
 *     from the palette's anchor in OKLab — as word fills. contrast-audit skips the
 *     `lattice` @import entirely, so it never sees a base-derived ink at all.
 *
 * That blind spot is the root cause this file exists to close. It was measured on
 * #1640: five brand palettes' `redline` runs and the `word-cloud` spectrum on
 * onyx / concrete / the four a11y palettes fell sub-threshold the moment the
 * palette wins the cascade (#1527, flipped 2026-08-17), and every gate in the
 * repo stayed green because no gate looks at a composed surface.
 *
 * ── What it resolves ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The merged token map is `dist/lattice.css`'s `:root` defaults with the palette
 * chain's `:root` on top — PALETTE WINS. That is the order `lib/engine/css.js`
 * `composeCss` has always used (Studio, docs Playground) and, since #1527's
 * concat flip, the order `lattice-emulator.js` builds the export bundle in too.
 * So this gate is now truthful for EVERY render path rather than for the engine
 * path with a promise attached. Evaluation is delegated to
 * `lib/core/resolve-token-expr` — the engine's own custom-property evaluator
 * (var() with fallback, light-dark() arms, color-mix() in oklab/srgb, a
 * `transparent` stop reduced to rgba) — so this gate cannot disagree with the
 * renderer about what a token means.
 *
 * ── The compositing model ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each surface is an ink inside a stack of nested element GROUPS over one opaque
 * base. A group carries its own background paint (possibly translucent) and its
 * own `opacity`. CSS `opacity` renders the subtree to a buffer and composites the
 * whole buffer — background included — at that alpha, which is why an opacity a
 * component sets for de-emphasis pulls BOTH the ink and its band toward the
 * backdrop and is invisible to any tool that reads computed `color` alone
 * (tools/check-slide-contrast.js cannot see it either — its number for a struck
 * `<del>` run is optimistic by design).
 *
 * ── The two arms ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every surface is scored in BOTH cascade orders, and the two answers gate
 * different things:
 *
 *   1. REGRESSION (budget 0, no exemptions). A palette's own curated value must
 *      not be WORSE than the base default it overrides, on a surface a component
 *      composes: base-wins clears the bar, palette-wins does not. This is the
 *      invariant #1527 needed — both #1640 findings are exactly this shape.
 *
 *      WHAT THE FLIP CHANGED HERE, AND WHAT IT DID NOT. Nothing about the numbers.
 *      Both arms are built by `mergedVars` out of the SAME two files, so this
 *      file's output is byte-identical before and after the concat change — it
 *      never read `lattice-emulator.js` and does not now. What changed is what the
 *      base-wins arm MEANS: until the flip it described a shipping path (the
 *      export bundle really did resolve the base's value), and now it describes no
 *      render anywhere.
 *
 *      It is kept deliberately, and the header said why before the flip made the
 *      question live: `base.tokens.css` is the reference standard an override is
 *      meant to IMPROVE on, so "the curated value is worse than the default it
 *      replaces" is a palette-curation defect whether or not any path paints the
 *      default. Deleting the arm would delete the only check that a re-tune moved
 *      a composed surface the wrong way — which is precisely the #1640 shape, and
 *      the reason this gate had to exist at all. Read the arm as a REFERENCE, not
 *      as a second cascade the repo ships.
 *
 *   2. ABSOLUTE (a frozen baseline, target zero). Which composed pairs are below
 *      their bar at all, and at what ratio. This population is large and mostly
 *      PRE-EXISTING — status ink on a 12% tint of itself is a hard surface, which
 *      is why the bar was proposed once before and reverted (see the `NOT audited
 *      (deliberately)` note in tools/contrast-audit.js). Re-curating fifteen
 *      palettes' status trios is its own slice (#1698), so the set is FROZEN
 *      rather than fixed: a new failure, an existing one getting worse, and a
 *      stale entry all fail.
 *
 * Any token the audit cannot resolve is a failure, not a skip — a skipped pair
 * reads as a pass, which is how a green gate hid a 2.49:1 rung (#1207).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/composed-contrast.js               # all themes
 *   node tools/composed-contrast.js indaco onyx   # specific themes
 *   node tools/composed-contrast.js --all         # list every pair, not just fails
 *
 * Gated by test/unit/palette/composed-surface-contrast.test.js.

// made the ramp's poles canvas-relative and re-anchored every palette's dark arm
// mid-range. All 24 are gone — deleted, not re-frozen, which is what the stale arm
// below exists to force.
//
// It is a keyed map rather than a count, and the difference is load-bearing. A
// count says "no MORE failures"; it says nothing about an existing failure getting
// worse, so a palette could take a 1.66:1 word fill to 1.03:1 with the gate green.

//
//   · a below-bar pair that is not listed          — a new defect
