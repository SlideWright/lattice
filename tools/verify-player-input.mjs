// Real-surface verification for the exported HTML player: TOUCH input (#1558) and the deck's
// declared CANVAS (#1577).
//
// HARD RULE #23: "verified" names a surface and carries an artifact from it. The claim here is
// "pinching a deck someone shared with you no longer turns the slide", which is a claim about
// a real file, opened from disk, driven by real fingers. jsdom has no touch stack and a
// synthesized DOM event is not a gesture — so this exports a REAL deck through the REAL CLI
// player path and drives it with genuine CDP touch points in a touch-enabled context.
//
// Two traps this is shaped around, both of which produced a false PASS while the Studio half
// of this fix (#1555) was being verified:
//
//   1. START MID-DECK. On slide 1 a misfired `prev` clamps, and a clamped no-op is
//      indistinguishable from a gesture correctly ignored. A harness that cannot tell those
//      apart is measuring the clamp.
//   2. PROVE THE GESTURE ARRIVED. "The counter did not move" is also what you see when no
//      touch event reached the page at all. So every pinch is instrumented: the run counts the
//      contacts the stage actually saw and REPLAYS the old measurement over the real
//      coordinates, printing the swipe the guard declined. A pass means "a gesture that would
//      have turned the deck did not", not "nothing happened".
//
// Run: node tools/verify-player-input.mjs            (writes .scratch/out/)
