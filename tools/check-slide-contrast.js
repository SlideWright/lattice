/**
 * check-slide-contrast — WCAG AA audit of the ACTUALLY RENDERED slide, not the
 * token table.
 *
 * Complements tools/contrast-audit.js rather than duplicating it (HARD RULE #15).
 * That tool checks each theme's own token matrix — the pairs a palette DECLARES.
 * It structurally cannot see a pairing a COMPONENT invents: `--text-secondary`
 * set on a `--cat-N-fill` panel, `--cat-N-mark` used as a card label, an ink
 * chosen against `--bg-alt` instead of `--bg`. Those only exist once a slide
 * renders. This walks the real DOM of a rendered deck, resolves every text run's
 * effective background by climbing ancestors through transparent paints, and
 * scores EVERY text run against WCAG AA's 4.5:1, large text included — see
 * `THE 3:1 LARGE-TEXT ALLOWANCE IS NOT GRANTED` below, the one place this tool is
 * deliberately stricter than the spec. It reads
 * pseudo-element text too, since this engine puts real content there (axis
 * labels, step badges, checkpoint labels).
 *
 * Born from #1207: the token audit was green at 704 pairs while the rendered
 * deck carried 44 sub-AA text runs, several as low as 2.54:1.
 *
 * ELEMENT OPACITY — read since #1640, and it was a real blind spot. A CSS
 * `opacity` renders the subtree to a buffer and composites the whole buffer — ink
 * AND background — at that alpha, which moves the ink much further than the band
 * under it. Reading computed `color` alone therefore reported an OPTIMISTIC number
 * for every run inside an opacity group, silently: on indaco's `redline .stacked`
 * (`del` at .85 inside a card at .78, both removed in #1640) it said ~5:1 where the
 * rendered pixels were 3.21:1. That figure is a `<del>` nested inside the .stacked
 * card — markup the CSS allows but no shipped deck writes, so it was measured on a
 * probe deck built to reach it; the DEFAULT variant every deck does render measured
 * 4.95:1 with the washes and 6.34:1 without. `resolveStack` below now walks the ink
 * and the backdrop through the SAME group stack, which is the only way the two can
 * be composited consistently. Validated against sampled pixels: within 0.01 on the
 * nested-wash runs (3.20 vs 3.21, 2.74 vs 2.75) and within 0.07 across the wider
 * set (4.98 / 5.15 / 3.85 / 6.99 modelled against 4.95 / 5.13 / 3.90 / 6.92). `tools/composed-contrast.js` models the same stack
 * statically, from the token table rather than a render.
 *
 * A CORRECTION, KEPT ON PURPOSE. This block used to claim that the running header is
 * "fully occluded by the left rail on every `split-*` layout … ink that never reaches
 * the page", and offered a measurement for it. That was FALSE. Rendered, the header is
 * painted in white on the dark rail and is perfectly legible. The four 1.00:1 rows it
 * was excusing were real output from a real bug — in THIS FILE, not in the engine:
 * `underlays()` approximated paint order by DOM order, so it discarded the rail (a
 * later, in-flow sibling) as a backdrop for out-of-flow chrome emitted before it. That
 * is fixed below, and those four rows are gone.
 *
 * The correction is worth more than the fix. The false claim was adopted as evidence by
 * a later change without anyone rendering the slide, and it survived review because a
 * tool's confident self-description reads exactly like a measurement. Treat this header
 * — including this paragraph — as a claim to re-verify, never as evidence.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION — OCCLUDED RUNS. Every run in the DOM and not `display:none` /
 * `visibility:hidden` is scored, including one painted UNDER an opaque sibling and so
 * not on screen at all. Such a run is neither a pass nor a failure, and no threshold
 * describes it; detecting it needs per-glyph hit-testing this deliberately does not do.
 * Treat a reported failure on text you cannot find in the render as a layering or
 * backdrop-sampling bug to chase, not a contrast one.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION — RASTER BACKDROPS. Backgrounds are read from `backgroundColor`, so
 * text over a photograph or gradient IMAGE resolves to whatever paint sits behind the
 * picture, usually the section canvas. Those rows are noise in both directions and are
 * why `image`-backed slides carry allowlist entries in the invariants gate rather than
 * a number this tool could ever get right.
 *
 * Usage:  node tools/check-slide-contrast.js <rendered-deck.html> [more.html ...]
 * Exits non-zero if any run falls below its AA threshold. On-demand, not a
 * blocking gate: the "muted chrome" tier (footer, pagination) is WCAG-exempt by
 * palette contract and will always report.

  // never to rgba(). An rgb()-only parser returns null for every one of those, and
  // the caller treats null as "not text" and DROPS the run: silent, not an error.
  // Measured on a 9-slide bookend/split probe, that hid 18 of 69 text runs (26%) —
  // and they were exactly the runs that matter, because the translucent ramp is the
  // only ink on a dark panel that isn't already white. Among them: a 2.49:1 closing

  // invisible to this tool for as long as it has existed (#1207 onward).
  // Channels in `color(srgb …)` are 0–1, so they scale to 0–255 here.
  //
  // AND THEN A GENERAL FALLBACK, because enumerating serializations is a losing
  // game: `color-mix(in oklab, …)` computes to `oklab(0.199 … / 0.62)`, and this
  // engine ships three text-bearing rules in that form (chart-family.css,
  // matrix-grid, kanban — a kanban column header drops 2 real runs). `display-p3`
  // is a fourth shape. Each new one would silently drop runs exactly as `color(srgb
  // …)` did, so the last resort hands the string to a 1x1 canvas and reads the
  // pixel: that resolves ANY color the UA can parse, including spaces this file has
  // never heard of, and gamut-maps wide-gamut values to the sRGB the WCAG formula is
  // defined on. Kept as a FALLBACK rather than the only path because the two exact
  // parsers above are lossless, while the canvas round-trips through premultiplied
  // storage and costs ~1/255 per channel at low alpha.

  // THE 3:1 LARGE-TEXT ALLOWANCE IS NOT GRANTED. Every run is scored against 4.5:1.
  //
  // WCAG AA lets text at 18pt — or 14pt bold — sit at 3:1 instead. Applying that to a
  // slide deck requires knowing a run's size IN POINTS, and this engine cannot hand you
  // one. Every `--fs-*` token is authored in `cqi`, a fraction of the slide's inline
  // size, so a design resolves to a different pixel count on every canvas: `--fs-body`
  // is 21.4px on an `hd` deck and 64.1px on a `4k` one. Reading those raw, a plain
  // `fs >= 24` calls ordinary body copy "large text" on any 4k deck — and both gated
  // galleries are 4k, so the lenient half was the half in force over ordinary prose.
  // Measured: rendering `gallery.md` at both sizes flips 1024 of 1534 runs between
  // thresholds and 317 pass/fail verdicts, on the front-matter `size:` line alone.
  //
  // THE OBVIOUS REPAIR IS TO NORMALIZE, AND IT DOES NOT SURVIVE CONTACT. Dividing each
  // run by its deck's canvas-over-reference ratio fixes landscape exactly, and was built
  // and measured before being deleted in favor of this. It needs ONE reference canvas,
  // and `lib/typography/scale.js` curates THREE scales against TWO reference widths
  // (landscape 1280, square/portrait 1080) with per-orientation coefficients that are
  // explicitly "curated, not derived from one another by a constant". Normalizing every
  // deck against 1280 therefore INFLATES portrait and square: measured on a rendered
  // `size: story` deck, `--fs-body` (47.0px) normalizes to 55.7px and grades as large
  // text at 3:1 — the same defect, moved to the ~20 committed portrait/square decks that
  // no gated surface measures. Nor is 1080 the repair: that file anchors portrait type on
  // the DEVICE ("body = 47px ⇒ ~17px on a phone"), i.e. ~12.75pt, which is normal text.
  // There is no unit conversion here, only a judgment about viewing scale, and the value
  // of the whole allowance is not worth encoding one.
  //
  // SO THE ALLOWANCE IS DROPPED RATHER THAN NORMALIZED. This is STRICTER than WCAG and
  // can never be more lenient, which is the only direction a contrast gate should err in.
  // It costs nothing measured: on all three gated surfaces, zero non-exempt runs sit
  // between 3:1 and 4.5:1. It is also invariant under everything that would have broken
  // the normalized version — a new entry in the size registry, a change to the default
  // canvas, a re-curation of the orientation scales, or a new preview surface.
  //
  // The cost is real but currently theoretical: genuinely poster-sized display type that
  // WCAG would pass at 3:1 fails here. Ornaments that can never clear 4.5:1 are handled
  // where they should be — as named entries in the invariants gate's exemption list, on
  // the record, rather than by a size heuristic that lets every large run through.
  //
  // Settled as #1722; engineering/decisions/2026-08-18-contrast-floor-deck-scale.md.

  // ancestors — see the two callers below; without it this function has two blind
  // spots that both report as failures, which is worse than silence because it
  // teaches the reader to ignore the output.
  //
  // `ink` seeds the TOP of the stack with the run's own foreground, so the same
  // walk answers both questions: `resolveStack(el, unders, fg)` is the glyph pixel
  // and `resolveStack(el, unders)` is the pixel beside it. That symmetry is what
  // makes element `opacity` readable at all. CSS `opacity` renders the subtree to a

    // under 50% red paints rgb(229,101,101) and this computes rgb(179,102,102).
    // Pre-dates the gate. An earlier draft of this note claimed it was "not live on any
    // gated surface: only 12 runs have ANY sibling underlay and ZERO composite two."
    // BOTH HALVES WERE WRONG — measured by instrumenting this accumulator: 16 runs have
    // an underlay, and TWO mixed-color composites are live, the `<del>` runs on p105
    // `redline` ([45,106,63 @0.1] over [153,27,27 @0.1] over opaque [242,245,250]).
    // True source-over gives rgb(214,211,211) → 5.59:1; this computes rgb(223,205,208)

  // BLIND SPOT 2: a paint that is a SIBLING, not an ancestor. This engine

  // white on the accent rail — a reported failure that was not real.
  //
  // Done by GEOMETRY, deliberately not by `document.elementsFromPoint`: that hit-
  // tests in VIEWPORT coordinates, and a rendered deck is one tall document with
  // every slide stacked, so it returns [] for every run below the fold (slide 6's
  // footer sits at y=4281 in a 720px viewport — measured, which is how the first cut
  // of this silently found nothing). It also skips `pointer-events:none`, which this
  // engine sets on several decorative fills. Rects are viewport-relative too, but
  // all of them share that origin, so containment comparisons hold at any scroll.
  //
  // Paint order is approximated by (PAINT LAYER, then DOM order). DOM order ALONE is
  // not enough, and the gap was not academic: it was the single largest source of
  // false failures this tool produced.
  //
  // The running header is out-of-flow chrome emitted FIRST in the section, and a
  // split layout's `.panel-left` rail is a later, in-flow sibling. CSS paints in-flow
  // block backgrounds (CSS 2.2 Appendix E, step 4) BEFORE positioned descendants
  // (step 8), so the rail really is underneath the header — but "later in the DOM"
  // said the opposite, so the rail was rejected as an underlay and the climb fell
  // through to the white section canvas. Measured on the gallery: `.panel-left` is
  // found, DOES contain the header's text rect, and was discarded on DOM order alone
  // — scoring four headers at 1.00:1 white-on-white that render in white on a dark
  // rail and are perfectly legible (p18, p94, p97, p98).
  //
  // `paintLayer` therefore ranks a box coarsely by Appendix E, and a node counts as an
  // underlay when it sits in a LOWER layer, whatever the DOM says. The run's own layer
  // is the max over itself and its ancestors up to the section, because a run paints
  // inside its nearest positioned ancestor's layer, not its own. Within one layer, DOM
  // order still decides — that is the old rule, preserved.
  //
  // NOT "strictly additive", though an earlier draft of this comment said so and that
  // was wrong. A node that PRECEDES the run but sits in a HIGHER layer was accepted by
  // the old DOM-order rule and is rejected now — correctly, because a `z-index: 1` rail
  // really does paint OVER in-flow text that follows it, and calling it a backdrop was
  // the old rule's mistake. A review built the counterexample and rendered it: an
  // absolutely-positioned z-1 panel before an in-flow `<p>` scored 7.17:1 under the old
  // filter and 1.58:1 under this one. Direction defensible, guarantee overstated.
  // Measured on the three gated galleries: 16 rows GAIN a backdrop and 34 LOSE one.
  // (An earlier draft of this line said "0 rows lose", which was wrong — the same shape
  // of unverified measurement the paragraph above apologizes for.) All 34 losses are
  // p91 `state-chart lr` SVG runs dropping `OL.state-nodes`/`LI.state-node` from their
  // underlay set; `.state-chart-edges` is `position:absolute; z-index:0`, deliberately
  // behind the node column, and every dropped paint is transparent, so no ratio moves.
  //
  // Done by GEOMETRY, deliberately not by `document.elementsFromPoint`: that hit-
  // tests in VIEWPORT coordinates, and a rendered deck is one tall document with

  // of this silently found nothing). It also skips `pointer-events:none`, which this
  // engine sets on several decorative fills. Rects are viewport-relative too, but
  // all of them share that origin, so containment comparisons hold at any scroll.
  //
  // Ancestors are excluded — the climb above already owns them.
  // `rect` defaults to the element box, but a caller with a tighter one should pass
  // it: the running header/footer are FULL-SLIDE-WIDTH boxes holding short
  // left-aligned text, so their box center lands on the far side of a split layout
  // from the glyphs. Sampling the box center scored slide 6's footer against the
  // white right half while its text sits on the accent rail — right arithmetic,
  // wrong place. The text loop passes the text node's own Range rect.
  //
  // STILL APPROXIMATE, in two named ways. It does not build real stacking contexts
  // (an `opacity`/`transform`/`filter` ancestor makes one, and z-index is scoped to

  /**
   * Does a paint this tool CANNOT SAMPLE lie under the run — a raster
   * `background-image`, or a gradient? Every backdrop here is read off
   * `backgroundColor`, so when the answer is yes the reported ratio is not merely
   * approximate, it is measuring the wrong thing: the climb sails past the picture
   * and lands on whatever opaque color sits behind it, usually the section canvas.
   *
   * Live case: `image statement` builds its backdrop as `div.lattice-bg` (a
   * `background-image: url(…)`) with a `div.image-scrim` gradient over it, and paints
   * white display text on top. Both divs have a fully transparent `backgroundColor`,
   * so the run scored 1.00:1 white-on-white against the section while rendering as
   * white on a dark photograph — legible, and nothing like the number.
   *
   * The flag is reported rather than acted on: this file keeps listing such runs so a
   * human can see them, and the invariants gate carries the policy (an explicit,
   * justified exemption) so the two concerns stay in one place each. Ancestors count
   * as well as underlays — a scrim on a wrapper is the same problem.
   *
   * `url()` ONLY, DELIBERATELY — NOT every `background-image`. The first cut of this
   * flagged any non-`none` background-image, and a review measured what that actually
   * caught: 205 of 1518 runs on the gallery (13.5%), because this engine paints RULES
   * with two-stop same-color `linear-gradient`s — a `glossary` row, `divider`, `code`,
   * `compare-table`. An exemption keyed on that flag stopped meaning "over a photograph"
   * and started meaning "one run in eight", wide enough to swallow an injected 1.11:1
   * regression on `glossary th` and a 1.2:1 one on twelve `divider` headlines while the
   * gate stayed green. A gradient is at least COMPOSED of colors this tool could in
   * principle sample; a decoded raster is not, and the raster is the case that motivated
   * the flag. So the net is the narrow one, and the invariants gate additionally pins the
   * exact count — breadth alone is never the only thing standing between a real defect
   * and a green build.
