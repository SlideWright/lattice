# Lumen Platform

The checkout migration is on track for 1 July — one risk needs a decision today.

---

<!-- _class: content -->
<!-- tier: short -->

## Bottom line: we ship checkout on Lumen 1 July, on plan, with one open call.

The migration of checkout to the Lumen platform is 78% complete and tracking to the 1 July cutover. Eleven of fourteen services are live in production. The only thing standing between us and the date is a load-testing decision I need from this room today.

## Why this matters now: the legacy checkout stack goes end-of-support 31 July.

The vendor pulls security patches for the legacy stack at the end of July. Migrating to Lumen before then keeps us supported and cuts our per-transaction cost by a third. Slipping past 1 July compresses the buffer between cutover and end-of-support to nothing.

- A clean two-week buffer is the difference between a calm launch and a forced one.
- Every week of delay is roughly $40K in avoidable legacy hosting spend.

## Where our open risks sit by likelihood and impact.

- **Low likelihood · Low impact.**
  - Documentation lag on internal APIs
- **Low likelihood · High impact.**
  - Payment-gateway timeout under peak load
- **High likelihood · Low impact.**
  - Minor dashboard parity gaps post-cutover
- **High likelihood · High impact.**
  - Unrehearsed peak load on cutover day

<!-- _class: checklist -->
<!-- tier: full -->

## Cutover readiness as of today.

- [x] Shadow parity sustained above 99.9% `7 days`
- [x] Runbook drafted and reviewed `Eng + SRE`
- [-] Peak-load rehearsal `awaiting decision`
- [-] Rollback procedure `dry-run pending`
- [ ] Final payment service live `this week`
- [ ] Executive go / no-go `25 Jun`

---

<!-- _class: decision -->
<!-- tier: short -->

## Decision today: run a full peak-load rehearsal before cutover.

- Run the peak-load rehearsal
  - One day of effort buys certainty that checkout holds at Black-Friday volume.
- Cut over on synthetic tests only
  - Saves a day but leaves the highest-impact risk unrehearsed on launch day.
