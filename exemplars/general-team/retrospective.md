# The 2 June payments outage

What happened, what we learned, and the four changes we are making.

---

<!-- _class: content -->
<!-- tier: short -->

## On 2 June, payments were down for 47 minutes — here is what we learned.

A configuration change took the payments service offline during the evening peak. We recovered in 47 minutes. This retro is blameless: the goal is to understand the system that let it happen and fix it, not to find a person to blame.

## The blameless frame: we fix systems, not people.

Good people made reasonable decisions with the information they had. The outage happened because our system let a single unreviewed change reach production at the worst possible time. We focus on the guardrails that were missing, not the hands on the keyboard.

- Every action item targets a process or a safeguard, never an individual.
- The engineer who made the change helped write this retro.

`2 June 2026 · all times local`

## How the incident unfolded, minute by minute.

1. `18:42` Config change deployed
   - A routing rule was pushed directly to production, bypassing staging.
2. `18:44` Payments begin failing `at-risk`
   - Error rate spikes to 100%; checkout returns errors.
3. `18:51` Incident declared `live`
   - On-call paged after customer reports; war room opened.
4. `19:29` Service restored `done`
   - The change was rolled back and traffic recovered fully.

## What went well, and what went poorly.

- **Went well · Detection.**
  - Customer reports reached us within two minutes
- **Went well · Response.**
  - War room and rollback ran cleanly once declared
- **Went poorly · Prevention.**
  - The change skipped staging entirely
- **Went poorly · Alerting.**
  - We learned from customers before our own monitors

## Root cause: a manual change path that bypassed every safeguard.

The routing rule was changed through a console that writes straight to production. There was no required review, no staging step, and no alert on the resulting error spike — so three independent safeguards were all absent on the same path.

- The console predates our deployment pipeline and was never retired.
- Error-rate alerting covered the API but not the routing layer.

`Response · this incident vs our targets`

## How our response compared to our incident targets.

`Targets from the incident-response runbook, last revised Q1 2026.`

1. 9 min
   - to declare (target 5)
2. 38 min
   - to mitigate (target 30)
3. 47 min
   - total downtime
4. 100%
   - transactions recovered

## The four changes we are making, with owners.

1. Retire the console
   - Direct production writes are disabled this week; all changes route through the pipeline. Owner: SRE.
2. Require staging
   - No config change reaches production without a staging deploy and a second reviewer. Owner: Platform.
3. Alert the routing layer
   - Error-rate alerts now cover routing, paging on-call within 60 seconds. Owner: SRE.
4. Rehearse rollback
   - A monthly game-day drills the rollback path so it stays fast. Owner: Eng leads.
