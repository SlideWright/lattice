/**
 * Lattice playground engine — browser entry (bundled to
 * docs/public/playground/lattice-playground.js by tools/build-playground.js).
 *
 * Renders Lattice markdown CLIENT-SIDE through the owned engine (lib/engine/) —
 * the SAME engine the emulator CLI ships — so the docs-site playground matches
 * the PDF output with no per-surface wiring. (Marp was retired in P4; this entry
 * no longer bundles marp-core, and the owned CSS emitter is the only packer.)
 *
 * Theme CSS (dist/lattice.css + themes/<name>.css) is NOT bundled — the page
 * fetches it from /playground/themes/ and registers it via addThemes(), so the
 * bundle stays engine-only and palettes load lazily.
 *
 * Public API (attached to window.LatticePlayground):
 *   addThemes(cssTextList)   register one or more @theme stylesheets
 *   hasTheme(name)           has a theme been registered?
 *   render(markdown, theme)  → { html, css, width, height } for the theme
 *                              (width/height = resolved `@size` box, px)
 *   marp                     Export-to-Marp bundle building blocks (the split
 *                            baker + shared bundle spec) for the in-browser export
