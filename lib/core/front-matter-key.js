/**
 * Read one KEY out of a deck's front matter — the linear-time way, in one place.
 *
 * The idiom this replaces was written twenty-odd times over:
 *
 *     fm.match(/^[ \t]*logo:[ \t]*["']?(.*?)["']?[ \t]*$/m)
 *
 * and it is polynomial. Three quantifiers — `[ \t]*`, the lazy `(.*?)`, and the
 * trailing `[ \t]*$` — can all match the same tab, so a long run of them makes the
 * engine try every split. Measured before this: a 128 KB run took 4.1 s in ONE
 * reader, and the runtime resolves ~20 of them. (An earlier round of this fix
 * bounded `\s` to `[ \t]`, which removed the NEWLINE dimension — the multiline
 * blowup — but left the single-line ambiguity behind. CodeQL was right to flag it
 * again.)
 *
 * The fix is the shape `lib/core/chart-narration.js` already uses and documents:
 * one GREEDY `(.*)` to end-of-line, which cannot fail and so never backtracks,
 * then trim and unquote in JS where those operations are linear by construction.
 *
 * The unquoting is deliberately two independent single-character strips, matching
 * the `["']?…["']?` it replaces: a value with one stray quote reads the same way it
 * always did, rather than newly failing to unquote.

/**
 * Clean ONE front-matter scalar — the single rule every reader in the repo has to
 * agree on, because the readers that DISAGREE are how a deck renders two ways.
 *
 * The defect this closes: a trailing YAML comment was kept as part of the value.
 * `theme: cuoio  # our brand palette` read as the literal string
 * `"cuoio  # our brand palette"`, which matches no registered palette — so the deck
 * silently fell back to the default while an Export-to-Marp of the same bytes (real
 * YAML, which strips the comment) kept `cuoio`. Two different decks from one source,
 * which is the failure #1416 exists to end.
 *
 * Three rules, and the second and third are load-bearing against real decks:
 *
 *  1. A QUOTED value is the quoted span. Anything after the closing quote is a
 *     comment and is dropped — `footer: 'Q3' # draft` → `Q3`.
 *  2. A `#` INSIDE a quoted span survives, because a quoted `#` is not a comment.
 *     `examples/default-slide-layout.md` ships `meta: "Default layout · #1292"`;
 *     a naive comment strip truncates it to `Default layout ·`. This is the one
 *     corpus deck that proves the quote-awareness is not theoretical.
 *  3. In an UNQUOTED value, only a WHITESPACE-PRECEDED `#` starts a comment. A `#`
 *     that opens the value, or that follows a non-space, is data:
 *       · `backgroundColor: #ffffff` → `#ffffff`. Strict YAML calls that a comment
 *         and demands quotes, but `color`/`backgroundColor` are real directives that
 *         take colors, so an unquoted hex is a deck someone would plausibly write
 *         and it works today. Breaking it to gain YAML purity would be a
 *         self-inflicted regression (HARD RULE #18) for no one's benefit.
 *       · `logo: /brand/mark.svg#icon` → kept, for the same reason.
 *
 * MALFORMED input (one stray quote) keeps the legacy single-character strip rather
 * than inventing a new behavior. `frontMatterValue` and `parseFrontMatter` used to
 * differ here — the former stripped a lone leading quote, the latter kept it — and
 * this unifies them on the former. Unobservable on every committed deck: a scan of
 * the corpus finds ZERO front-matter values with unbalanced quotes.
 *
 * @param {string} raw the text after `key:` to end-of-line
 * @returns {string} the cleaned scalar
