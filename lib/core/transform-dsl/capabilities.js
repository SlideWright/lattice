/**
 * Transform-DSL capability registry — §8 of
 * `engineering/decisions/2026-06-29-component-transform-dsl.md`.
 *
 * The declarative core (extract/wrap/…) is deliberately INERT — no codegen, no
 * measurement, no URL resolution. Everything imperative is reached BY NAME from a
 * rule (`{ "capability": "panel-eyebrow" }`) through this CLOSED first-party
 * allowlist. The manifest *wires* a capability; it never *contains* one. An
 * unknown name is rejected by the schema before the interpreter runs.
 *
 * This is the headroom hinge: a power we can only do in reviewed JS becomes
 * declaratively wireable the moment it is registered here — with no grammar
 * change and no widening of the untrusted surface.
 *
 * PROTOTYPE (§11): exactly one real capability — `panel-eyebrow` — proving the
 * bridge composes with the declarative extract/wrap ops on a real component
 * (split-panel). Each capability:
 *   • operates on the matched section's OWN DOM scope (section-scoping holds);
 *   • is DOM-based, so the string path and the runtime path share its code
 *     (parity by construction);
 *   • inherits the render-guard budget via `ctx.spend()`;
 *   • emits only allowlisted elements, and validates any URL before emitting
 *     (none here — `panel-eyebrow` is text-only).
 *
 * No dependency on `schema.js` (it depends on us) — keep this leaf-level.
