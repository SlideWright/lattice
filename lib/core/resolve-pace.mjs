/**
 * lib/core/resolve-pace.mjs
 *
 * The deck front-matter `pace:` register — the deck's PRESENTATION RHYTHM: how long
 * a self-presenting deck holds on a newly-arrived slide before it starts speaking.
 *
 *   pace: brisk        a demo, a familiar audience        (~0.8s slide / 1.6s section)
 *   pace: natural      boardroom delivery — the default   (~1.4s slide / 2.6s section)
 *   pace: deliberate   a technical or non-native audience (~2.2s slide / 4.0s section)
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A DECK REGISTER AND NOT A SETTING. The beat itself shipped first as a
 * workspace preference in `localStorage`, which makes the rhythm a property of the
 * MACHINE DOING THE PLAYING rather than of the deck. For an author rehearsing their own
 * deck that is invisible; for the product claim — ship a deck for the board, or share a
 * deck and have it present itself — it is backwards, because the author's directorial
 * choice is lost the moment the deck leaves their machine. A deliberately slow, weighty
 * deck would play at whatever pace the recipient's browser happened to hold.
 *
 * RESOLUTION ORDER, stated once (and pinned by resolve-pace.test.js):
 *
 *   1. an explicit millisecond override    the presenter's live "faster/slower" during a
 *                                          delivery. Never persisted into the artifact.
 *   2. the deck's own `pace:`              the author's intent, and it travels with the deck.
 *   3. the workspace preset                a DEFAULT for decks that declare no pace — not
 *                                          an override of one that does.
 *   4. `natural`                           the shipped default.
 *
 * The live Studio's cadence kernel (`docs/src/lib/cadenza/cadence.ts`, `PACE_PRESETS` +
 * `slideBeatMs`) owns these same milliseconds for the *rehearsal* surface. It is TypeScript
 * inside the `@slidewright/cadenza` workspace package, so this file cannot import it — and it
 * cannot import this one either without a relative path escaping its own package boundary.
 * So the numbers are stated in BOTH places and `pace-names.test.js` pins them against each
 * other, exactly as it already pins the NAMES: nobody can import their way out of that split,
 * so the test is the seam.
 *
 * The engine copy below is not redundant. `lib/export/player-core.mjs` — the assembler for the
 * self-contained `.html` player — has to resolve a beat with no browser, no workspace package,
 * and no front matter left in the document (the assembler strips every non-envelope `<script>`,
 * so the baked `application/lattice-front-matter` block does NOT survive into the player). It
 * reads the deck's `pace:` off the verbatim source at assembly time and bakes the resolved
 * milliseconds in, which is what lets a SHARED deck keep the author's rhythm.
 *
 * ESM, and self-contained, mirroring `resolve-captions.mjs` — the module this is most like (a
 * narration front-matter register the docs site imports directly). That is not a style choice:
 * the docs production build is Rollup, which will not resolve named exports off a CommonJS file
 * outside its root, so a CJS module here fails `astro build` while passing vitest AND `tsc`.
 * The front-matter regex is inlined for the same reason `resolve-captions.mjs` inlines its own,
 * rather than reaching for the CJS `front-matter-key.js`.
 *
 * The consequence is that `lib/authoring/lint.js` (CommonJS) cannot require this, so the linter
 * keeps its own copy of the names in `lint-core.js` — where the rule lives anyway, per HARD RULE
 * #7. `pace-names.test.js` pins every copy against every other.
