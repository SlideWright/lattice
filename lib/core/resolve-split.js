/**
 * lib/core/resolve-split.js
 *
 * The deck front-matter `split:` key selects how the body is divided into
 * slides. It is a Lattice extension (Marpit splits only on the `---` thematic
 * break, or on h1..hN when its native `headingDivider:` integer is set). Two
 * modes, deliberately binary:
 *
 *   split: rule       → split ONLY on a top-level `---` (Marp-compatible).
 *                       Opt back into the classic separator-only behaviour.
 *   split: headings   → the house "sticky rule": the first `#` opens the lead
 *                       slide and every subsequent h1/h2 opens a new slide.
 *                       THE DEFAULT (since the 2026-06 flip) — a deck divides on
 *                       its outline with no separators to forget.
 *                       Lead content BEFORE a heading (an eyebrow tag, a kicker)
 *                       attaches to that heading's slide — the split fires only
 *                       before the *second* heading in a slide — so the eyebrow
 *                       never orphans. `---` is ALSO honoured (hybrid), so an
 *                       author can still force a break where two slides would
 *                       share a heading or a slide carries no heading at all.
 *
 * Why this is NOT marp-core's native `headingDivider`: that splits before
 * EVERY qualifying heading, which orphans the eyebrow/kicker block Lattice
 * decks put above their titles (~40% of the corpus). The eyebrow-aware rule
 * here is implemented as a shared markdown-it `hr`-injection ruler (see
 * lib/integrations/markdown-it/plugins.js `headingSplit`) so the emulator and the
 * marp-cli export stay byte-identical (HARD RULE #1). Both modes are
 * slide-count-invariant on every committed deck (see the regression in
 * test/unit/parsing/heading-split.test.js).
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free so it bundles into the browser runtime (esbuild) and
 * is unit-testable in isolation, mirroring lib/core/resolve-finish.js.
