/**
 * Component Studio — the AI tier's PURE pieces (the component analog of

 *
 * The architecture mirrors the shipped Theme AI (#613): the model only ever

const COMPONENT_CANON =
  'HOW A LATTICE COMPONENT IS BUILT (so your draft feels native, not generic CSS):\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• FORM VOCABULARY. A slide is a Frame divided into Cells; the content Cell hosts a Tile — your component. ' +
  'The Frame auto-supplies the chrome: the masthead band lifts the eyebrow + the `h2` title; the footer supplies ' +
  'running text, section progress, and the page number. NEVER re-implement chrome (no title bar, no page number, ' +
  'no progress rail). Your CSS targets ONLY the body, which lives under `section.<name> > .cell-stage` — a flex column.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• ROOT. Always `section.<name> > .cell-stage { display:flex; flex-direction:column; }` plus `flex:1; min-height:0` ' +
  'on the list so rows distribute into the bounded stage (the stage clips + measures overflow — without `min-height:0` a ' +
  'dense deck overruns and clips).\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• CARDS ARE LIST ITEMS, never `<div>`s. Author markdown is `- Label` (one line) with an optional nested `  - body`. ' +
  'The list is `ul/ol > li` with `list-style:none; padding:0; margin:0`; the lead text AUTO-BOLDS via CSS — the author ' +
  'writes `- Signal custody`, NEVER `- **Signal custody.** body`. The body is a nested list that spans a full-width row ' +
  'below the header (`flex:0 0 100%`).\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• AUTHOR WITH THE MARKDOWN STRUCTURE THAT FITS THE DATA — and it MUST be valid markdown. Your choices, all transform-free ' +
  '(no custom code, just CSS over the native DOM the markdown produces):\n' +
  '   – LIST (`ul/ol > li`) — a SET of items (cards, rosters, checklists, glossaries).\n' +
  '   – TABLE (a GFM markdown table: a header row, a `| --- | --- |` divider, then rows) — a GRID of values that reads ACROSS ' +
  'columns (features × plans, duties × parties). It renders to a native `<table>`; style `section.<name> table`, ' +
  '`section.<name> thead th`, `section.<name> td` with tokens + `border-bottom:1px solid var(--border)` (NEVER margin, ' +
  '`border-collapse:collapse`). When the data is a matrix, USE A TABLE — do not fake it with a list or a grid of divs.\n' +
  '   – PROSE paragraph — a statement / callout. FENCED CODE (```lang) — a code sample (the engine highlights it; do not ' +
  'restyle the tokens). MATH (`$$…$$`) — the engine renders it. Pick lists vs tables vs prose by the shape of the content.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• STATE MARKERS ARE A UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR — use them when a ROW carries done/partial/pending status; never re-invent status. A ' +
  'leading bracket marker on a list item OR a table cell is AUTO-CHROME the engine decodes into a colour-blind-safe status disc ' +
  '(a shape + a state token): `[x]` = done/pass, `[-]` = partial/qualified, `[ ]` = todo/pending (neutral; "not met" only in a ' +
  'verdict grid), `[/]` = out of scope/waived. Author `- [x] Item` (or `| Clause | [x] | [ ] |`); do NOT style the `.state` disc ' +
  'yourself (it is universal), and do NOT fake status with a raw emoji, a colored hex, or a bare bullet. Reach for markers on a ' +
  'readiness checklist, a coverage/obligation matrix, or a criteria verdict — NOT on a plain inventory list (a status PILL fits ' +
  'a one-word label; a MARKER fits a true status axis).\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• THE SLIDE GRAMMAR — ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The chrome slots are AUTO-DETECTED by POSITION, so a block in the wrong ' +
  'place is read as a different slot (or breaks). Emit the skeleton in THIS order:\n' +
  '   1. EYEBROW — an inline-code-ONLY paragraph (a line that is just `` `Label` ``) placed IMMEDIATELY ABOVE the `##` heading.\n' +
  '   2. TITLE — the `## heading` (the Frame lifts it into the masthead; never style it).\n' +
  '   3. SUBTITLE — a plain (or `_italic_`) paragraph IMMEDIATELY AFTER the heading.\n' +
  '   4. CONTENT — your list / table / prose (the body you actually style).\n' +
  '   5. KEY-INSIGHT — a TRAILING `> blockquote` at the very end → the accent takeaway bar (auto-chrome; do not draw it).\n' +
  '   6. BELOW-NOTE — a final short paragraph led by an em-dash (`— …`), or a trailing `_italic_` annotation paragraph.\n' +
  'INLINE CODE means different things BY POSITION: a `code`-only paragraph above the heading is the EYEBROW; a TRAILING ' +
  '`code` on a list row is a PILL (a one/two-word status chip); `code` elsewhere is a label/citation chip. Same token, ' +
  'different slot — the position decides.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• THE SKELETON IS PURE MARKDOWN — NO RAW HTML TAGS. The engine builds every structure from the markdown DOM, so you NEVER ' +
  'need a tag. Do not emit `<div>`, `<span>`, `<br>`, `<table>` (write a GFM pipe table instead), and ABSOLUTELY never `<script>`/' +
  '`<style>`/`<iframe>` (an XSS/style-override vector — the gate rejects ANY raw tag). To SHOW code, use inline `` `code` `` or a ' +
  '```fence (there the `<tag>` is escaped text, not live HTML). The ONE allowed HTML is the `<!-- … -->` comment — the ' +
  '`<!-- _class: <name> -->` directive, and any other `<!-- presenter / reader note -->` you want to leave; comments are kept.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• ZERO non-reset `margin`. A bare `margin:0` reset is the ONLY margin allowed; all real spacing is `gap` (between flex/grid ' +
  'children) or `padding` (inside a box), sized with `--sp-*`. Right-anchor a pill with `justify-content:space-between` or a ' +
  '`flex:1` spacer — NEVER `margin-left:auto` or `margin:auto`. (margin is invisible to the height math the stage depends on.) ' +
  'The #1 recurring trap is a CUSTOM `::before` MARKER (a `content:"•"`/dot/icon bullet): space it from the text with ' +
  '`padding-right`, or make the row `display:flex; gap:…` — NEVER `margin-right` on the pseudo. (Spacing columns/cards is the ' +
  'same rule: `gap` on the grid/flex CONTAINER, never a `margin` on the child.) BEFORE you return, scan your own CSS: if any ' +
  '`margin` appears that is not `margin:0` — including on a `::before`/`::after` — it is a bug; rewrite it as `gap`/`padding`.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• COMPOSE ONLY FROM TOKENS — never invent a value. Color: `--bg`, `--bg-alt`, `--border`, `--text-heading`, `--text-body`, ' +
  '`--text-secondary`, `--text-muted`; accent `--accent`, `--accent-soft`, `--on-accent`, `--on-accent-soft`; state `--pass`, ' +
  '`--warn`, `--fail`; categorical `--cat-1-mark … --cat-12-mark`. ZERO hex. Type is the 12-token `--fs-*` ROLE system — pick ' +
  'by role, never a raw px/cqi/rem: `--fs-meta` (11pt chrome) · `--fs-body-compact` (13pt dense cells) · `--fs-body` (16pt default) ' +
  '· `--fs-message` (21pt statement) · `--fs-emphasis` (30pt lead); headings `--fs-h1 … --fs-h6` (`--fs-h2` 28pt = standard title); ' +
  '`--fs-hero` (86pt, the one monumental number). Spacing `--sp-3xs … --sp-2xl`; geometry in `cqi`/`cqh`; radius `--radius-sm/-md`; ' +
  'pills inherit the `--pill-*` family.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• PREFER FLEX — reach for `grid` only with a proven reason. `display:flex` is the DEFAULT layout primitive for a component body: ' +
  'a single row/column (`flex-direction`), a wrapping multi-column deck (the "matrix" idiom), an evenly-split comparison (`flex:1` per ' +
  'side) — flex handles them all, and it reflows for portrait with a one-line `flex-direction:column` / `width:100%`. MULTI-COLUMN is the ' +
  'flex matrix: `display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:var(--sp-md)` on the list + `box-sizing:border-box; width:calc(50% - var(--sp-md)/2)` ' +
  'on the cards (NEVER a flex-`basis` calc — proven unreliable). An EVEN split is even simpler: `display:flex; gap` on the list, `flex:1 1 0; ' +
  'min-width:0` on each child. Reach for `display:grid` ONLY when the layout genuinely needs TWO-dimensional alignment that flex cannot give — ' +
  'cells that must line up across BOTH rows AND columns simultaneously (a real matrix). But a true matrix is almost always tabular DATA, which ' +
  'belongs in a `<table>` (see the table guidance) — so in practice flex covers nearly every card/panel/split layout, and an unexamined ' +
  '`grid-template-columns` is a smell. If you do use grid, justify it to yourself first; otherwise rewrite it as flex.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• BOX-LOCAL REFLOW for portrait/tall frames: `@container lattice (aspect-ratio <= 1.05) { … width:100% … }` to drop to a single ' +
  'column. Use the DOUBLED-CLASS specificity trick — `section.<name>.<name> > .cell-stage > ul > li` — so the reflow rule outranks ' +
  'the base multi-column rule (the `width:calc(50% …)` on the flex cards, or a `flex-direction` on an even split). This is the single ' +
  'most error-prone idiom; copy it exactly.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• THE SLOT VOCABULARY (auto-detected from markdown — author the CONTENT slots; NEVER re-draw a CHROME slot). CHROME (the Frame ' +
  'supplies these — do not style them): the masthead lifts the EYEBROW (`p > code:only-child` ABOVE the `h2`) + the TITLE (`h2`); the ' +
  'SUBTITLE is inline `code` just BELOW the heading; the FOOTER band carries running text, the PAGINATION (page number) and the PROGRESS ' +
  'mark; the LOGO is the author brand mark, top-right, from front-matter. CONTENT slots you DO author: the METADATA PILL (a trailing inline ' +
  '`code` on a card line → a chip), the KEY-INSIGHT (a trailing `blockquote`), the BELOW-NOTE (an em-dash `<p>`). RAIL IS NOT ONE SLOT — three ' +
  'things share the word, do not confuse them: (a) the PROGRESS rail = the footer\'s section-progress mark, auto-chrome you must NOT draw; ' +
  '(b) a SPLIT/SOVEREIGN rail = a dark side column only a `form: split` component owns; (c) an agenda-style `.rail` = a per-component variant ' +
  'class. A side rail is a split-form or a variant concern — never a universal slot you hand-author.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• TAXONOMY — classify the component correctly (drives the manifest + dedup). The buckets and what each is FOR: anchor (title/section/closing ' +
  'covers) · statement (one big idea / KPI / quote) · INVENTORY (lists, cards, rosters, ledgers, glossaries — your home bucket) · comparison ' +
  '(two-or-more options side by side) · progression (steps/stages/phases over time) · evidence (proof: tables, stats, citations) · imagery ' +
  '(photo-led) · chart · diagram · math · code · legal. Pick the `function`/`form`/`substance` that matches; for a transform-free CSS component ' +
  'stay in inventory/comparison/evidence/legal (+ code/math prose).\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• RESTRAINT (the 10/10 rubric, checkable not vibes): one accent, reserved for the verdict — not decoration; SIX distinct hierarchy levels ' +
  '(if two adjacent levels look the same it is broken); cards never touch the stage edges (always `padding`); ≤ ~6 cards, ≤ ~40 words, ≤ 6 ' +
  'bullets; state carried by SHAPE + a state token, not color alone; categorical hues capped ~6–8 (Wong 2011); contrast checked against ' +
  '`--bg-alt`, not just `--bg`.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• DESIGN FOR FIT — the structure must EARN its capacity, not just declare one. Reason about how the content fills the bounded stage ' +
  'BEFORE you pick a layout, because the #1 generated-component failure is a sparse, dead-space slide (a few small cards adrift in a sea of ' +
  'empty, or a KPI number left body-sized). Two rules: (a) the SWEET count must FILL the stage handsomely — choose the column/row count so a ' +
  'sweet-many tiles cleanly (2 items → one row of two big panels, 4 → a 2×2, 6 → 2×3), and let the cards GROW into the space (`flex:1; ' +
  'min-height:0` on the list so rows distribute; the cards stretch, they do not float at intrinsic size). (b) the HARD count must sit just ' +
  'BELOW overflow — past it the stage clips. Match `capacity` to what THIS layout legibly holds, never a boilerplate `{4,6,8}`: a two-panel ' +
  'comparison is `{sweet:2,soft:2,hard:3}`, a single monument is `{sweet:1,soft:1,hard:1}`. And SIZE TO THE ROLE — when the payload is ONE ' +
  'number or a short verdict, make it MONUMENTAL (`--fs-hero` / `--fs-emphasis`), not a lonely `--fs-body` line; a statement component that ' +
  'reads small in a big frame is the dead-space defect by another name.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• WRITE TO THE WORD BUDGET — density is a contract, not a suggestion. Each element along the collection axis gets a TIGHT words-per-element ' +
  'budget: a label + a short clause, NEVER a sentence that wraps to three lines. Declare it as `density:{"axis":"item","soft":S,"hard":H}` ' +
  '(`item` = list/grid entries, `row` = table rows — the only two the counter measures) where `soft` is the editorial target (the count you ' +
  'design the card WIDTH around) and `hard` is the wall-of-text ceiling. Then HONOR it in your own skeleton: the sample rows you emit must ' +
  'themselves sit within `soft`, so the component demonstrates the brevity it asks for — a card built for 6-word labels but seeded with a ' +
  '20-word paragraph teaches the wrong shape and overflows the moment it is reused. (This is per-ELEMENT; the slide-level ≤~40-word budget in ' +
  'RESTRAINT still holds on top.)\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• RESPONSIVE BY CONSTRUCTION — design the reflow up front, do not bolt it on. Every component must stay legible in a WIDE box AND a ' +
  'TALL/strip one, because the same Tile is dropped into landscape decks, portrait/social frames, and narrow nested cells. Bake in the ' +
  '`@container lattice (aspect-ratio <= 1.05)` single-column drop (the BOX-LOCAL REFLOW idiom above) as part of the FIRST draft, not a ' +
  'follow-up — a multi-column grid with no portrait rule is an unfinished component. Size with `cqi`/`cqh` and the `--fs-*` roles (which already ' +
  'scale with the box) so the body reflows fluidly between the two extremes, and keep `capacity` honest about it: a strip honestly holds fewer ' +
  'than a wide, so the count that fills a landscape row must still clip cleanly when it stacks.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• START BOARDROOM, ESCALATE ON DEMAND. The DEFAULT is the killer boardroom framework — clean, restrained, one accent, no gimmicks; ' +
  'that is the FLOOR and the right answer for a plain ask ("a list of risks", "three KPIs", "a quarterly summary"). Do NOT decorate a ' +
  'neutral request. But MATCH the visual ambition to the concept: a request that names a distinctive form or feel ("like a boarding ' +
  'pass", "a honeycomb of skills", "terminal-style", "a vintage receipt", "a polaroid wall") UNLOCKS proportionally more creative ' +
  'freedom — go as far as the concept earns, no further. At every level the result stays BOARDROOM-READY: legible first, on-palette, ' +
  'restrained accent, nothing that fights the brand. Creativity SERVES the concept; it never overrides clarity.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• DARE A DISTINCTIVE VISUAL IDENTITY (when the concept calls for it, per the rule above) — rich CSS is IN SCOPE, not just bordered ' +
  'boxes. "Transform-free" bars generated GEOMETRY / ' +
  'codegen, NOT decorative CSS. For a request with a strong visual concept (a boarding pass, a receipt, a terminal/console panel, a ' +
  'polaroid, a luggage tag, a wax-seal stamp, a filmstrip) you SHOULD reach for the full pure-CSS toolkit to make it unmistakable: ' +
  '`linear/radial/conic-gradient` + `repeating-linear/radial-gradient` (a BARCODE is a `repeating-linear-gradient`; a ticket ' +
  'PERFORATION is a `radial-gradient` of evenly-spaced dots), `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements (badges, ribbons, corner folds, ' +
  'edge notches), `clip-path` (a ticket stub, a chevron, a torn edge), `mask`, layered `box-shadow` (elevation, inset rules), ' +
  '`border`/`outline`/`border-radius` tricks, even a static `transform: rotate()/scale()` for a stamp or ribbon. SHAPE IS YOURS TOO — ' +
  'a card need not be a rectangle: `border-radius:50%` + `aspect-ratio:1` makes a DISC (circular avatars, a radial badge), ' +
  '`clip-path:polygon(…)` cuts a HEXAGON, TRIANGLE, DIAMOND, or chevron TAB, a pill is a fully-rounded rect. Reach for an odd shape ' +
  'when it serves the concept (a honeycomb of capabilities, circular team avatars, diamond milestones, a hexagon skill grid) — ' +
  'TASTEFULLY, never gratuitously, and mind legibility (text stays inside the safe rectangle of a clipped shape, via `padding`). ' +
  'This is all PURE ' +
  'CSS over the markdown DOM — NEVER a reason to decline. The rails still bind every pixel: colors are `var(--…)` tokens (ZERO hex), ' +
  'type is `--fs-*`, spacing is `gap`/`padding` (no margin), all selectors under `section.<name>`. Restraint governs the ACCENT ' +
  '(one, for the verdict) — but TEXTURE and FORM (a perforation, a stub edge, a barcode, a scanline) are free; spend them when the ' +
  'concept earns it. The neutral surface/border/`--text-muted` tokens carry most decorative work without touching the accent.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• THE OTHER INVARIANTS (with the why): SCOPING (#7) — every selector starts `section.<name>` so styles can never leak onto another slide; ' +
  'the gate rejects a bare `ul`/`h2`. US ENGLISH (#21) — every word a human reads (class names, comments, copy) uses the US spelling (`color`, ' +
  '`gray`, `behavior`, `center`), never the British form. card-nesting (#5) — `- Title` / `  - body`, never inline `- **Title.** body` (the title ' +
  'is a structural slot the CSS bolds, not editorial `**`).\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• MANIFEST IS THE CONTRACT. Always declare `adapt` (how the component reflows — `{"mode":"native"}` when it relies on the universal cqi ' +
  'scaling + the `@container lattice` reflow above; `{"mode":"reflow"}` once it ships per-family layouts) and `capacity` (its legible ceiling — ' +
  '`{"sweet":4,"soft":6,"hard":8}`: the comfortable, the stretched, and the hard cap on cards/rows before it should escalate to a denser sibling) ' +
  'and `density` (the words-per-element budget — `{"axis":"item","soft":6,"hard":12}` — that keeps each card terse; see WRITE TO THE WORD ' +
  'BUDGET above). `capacity` budgets the element COUNT; `density` budgets the words inside each one. ' +
  'A component that never declares how it adapts will overflow a portrait frame — declare it.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '• DECLINE only when COMPUTED GEOMETRY or CODEGEN is required — never for a LOOK. You author from the native DOM valid markdown ' +
  'produces (lists, TABLES, prose, fenced code, math), and you may style it with the full pure-CSS toolkit incl. gradients, ' +
  'pseudo-elements, `clip-path`, masks, and odd shapes (the DARE bullet). A distinctive VISUAL IDENTITY — a boarding pass, a barcode, ' +
  'a perforation, a hexagon card, a terminal panel — is ALWAYS buildable in pure CSS, so it is NEVER grounds to decline. Decline ONLY ' +
  'when the structure itself must be COMPUTED or GENERATED: a chart (data plotted to axes/bars/arcs), a diagram (nodes + drawn ' +
  'connectors), a 2-D positioned MAP (items placed by an x/y value — a quadrant/scatter), a timeline/roadmap/journey (a positioned ' +
  'track), generated/highlighted source beyond a plain fenced block. A matrix is a TABLE, not a decline. When a transform is ' +
  'genuinely required, return a decline (see the output contract) routing to a first-party build, NOT a broken fake.\n';
