/**
 * notes-core — the pure, browser-safe presenter-notes extractor.
 *
 * LFM treats a non-directive HTML comment on a slide as that slide's speaker
 * note (Marp-faithful). This module is the SINGLE SOURCE for *what counts as a
 * note* — the note/non-note boundary — which is the part HARD RULE #1 protects
 * from drift. It does NOT itself materialize notes; each render path surfaces
 * them through its own channel, and they only stay consistent if they agree on
 * the boundary. Where each path stands today:
 *
 *   - lattice-emulator.js     — uses this module to embed each note as a
 *                               per-page PDF text annotation and a hidden
 *                               `aside.lattice-notes` element in the HTML
 *                               sidecar. This is the only path that materializes
 *                               notes itself.
 *   - lib/engine            — does NOT post-process notes; the engine collects
 *                               the *same* comments natively (its exclusion set
 *                               is the one mirrored below), so a user who runs
 *                               `marp --pdf-notes` / exports PPTX gets notes with
 *                               an identical boundary. The shipped Lattice PDF is
 *                               produced by the emulator, not marp.
 *   - dist/lattice-runtime.js — the VS Code preview does not surface notes today
 *                               (future work); when it does, it MUST extract them
 *                               through this module so the boundary still agrees.
 *
 * Like lint-core, this is pure and fs-free so it runs identically in Node, a CI
 * gate, and the browser.
 *
 * It operates on engine-RENDERED slide HTML, where Marpit/lib-engine has already
 * consumed directive comments (`_class`, `paginate`, …). What survives is either
 * a genuine note or a tooling pragma (markdownlint / prettier / remark-lint).
 * The pragma set below is copied verbatim from Marpit's own comment plugin
 * (node_modules/@marp-team/marpit/lib/markdown/comment.js → magicCommentMatchers)
 * so this extractor excludes exactly what marp-core excludes; the parity test in
 * test/unit/authoring/notes-core.test.js locks the two together.
