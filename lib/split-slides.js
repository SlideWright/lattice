/**
 * Fence-aware slide splitter for Lattice / Marp source.
 *
 * Marp splits on top-level `---` (and on h1..hN when `headingDivider: N`
 * is set in front matter). The naive regex split that the emulator
 * previously used was incorrect inside fenced code blocks — any `---`
 * line inside a ``` … ``` or ~~~ … ~~~ block was mis-treated as a slide
 * boundary, which broke decks that demonstrate Markdown samples (the
 * templates docs and authoring-proposals notes routinely do this).
 *
 * Algorithm: walk lines, track open-fence state (``` or ~~~ with
 * matching closer length), and split only when an `---` line appears
 * outside a fence. When `headingDivider` is set, also split on
 * heading-of-level ≤ N at the start of a line outside a fence.
 *
 * Mirrors what markdown-it/Marpit do without pulling them in for just
 * the splitter — fence tracking is small and self-contained, and the
 * authoritative cross-check is the parity test that asserts emulator
 * and marp-cli agree on slide count for the gallery.
 *
 * Front matter (the leading `---\n…\n---\n` block) should be stripped
 * by the caller before invoking this; this splitter operates on the
 * body only.
