# divider

> Section boundary slide. Dark canvas with a single heading.

**Function** anchor · **Form** divider · **Substance** prose

**Tags** `section-break` · `agenda-setting` · `walkthrough`

Marks the start of a major section. Use sparingly — every divider is a context switch for the audience. A 30-slide deck typically has 3-5 dividers; more becomes navigation noise.

## When to use

- **Major section starts.** Marks the boundary between two themed sections of the deck. The dark canvas is a strong context-switch signal — use it when the audience needs to re-orient.
- **Sparingly.** A 30-slide deck typically has 3-5 dividers. More becomes navigation noise; the signal weakens if every third slide is a divider.
- **With an eyebrow.** An inline-code paragraph above the heading stamps a section number or category label. Useful for serialized decks where the audience needs to remember which section they're in.
- **Light variant for sub-section orientation.** The `light` variant keeps the bright body-slide canvas and centers the heading at h2 weight — a lighter context switch for narrowing focus within a section, between a dark divider and the content slides. (Absorbed the standalone `subtopic` component on 2026-06-07.)

## When NOT to use

- **More than five per deck.** Each divider is a hard context switch. Too many dilutes the signal and slows the audience. Group related content under fewer sections instead.
- **Section title that doesn't earn a section.** If the next 3-4 slides aren't a coherent unit, the `light` variant (bright canvas, centered) is the right tool. Reserve the dark divider for genuine section starts.
- **Header or footer overrides.** Don't reinstate `_header:` or `_footer:` on a divider. The dark canvas is meant to be uninterrupted; chrome belongs on body slides.

## Variants (layout-specific)

### `numbered` — Numbered — auto-incrementing section index

Stamps an auto-incrementing section number in the corner. Each divider in the deck increments the counter; closing slides carry an independent counter.

```markdown
<!-- _class: divider silent numbered -->

`Section 03`

```

### `light` — Light — bright-canvas sub-section break

Drops the dark canvas for the standard bright body-slide background, centers the heading, and shrinks it to h2 weight. Use for mid-section orientation that shouldn't carry the full context-switch weight of a dark divider. Absorbed the standalone `subtopic` component on 2026-06-07.

<!-- _class: divider light -->
