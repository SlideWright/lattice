# video

`Imagery · Canvas · Prose`

A video as a static, PDF-safe embed: a poster that links to the clip, a play badge, the provider's name, and a scannable QR to the same URL — never a live iframe.

## When NOT to reach for video.

- **Expecting it to autoplay in the PDF.** A PDF is paper — it can't play video, and the engine bars iframes for security. `video` is a poster + scannable link by design. If you need in-app playback, that's a separate interactive surface, not a boardroom deck.
- **A wall of caption.** The caption is one line — 'Scan to watch', a title, a runtime. If you're writing a paragraph about the video, put it in a `content` slide and drop the clip in as a supporting `video`.
- **Instagram with no poster.** Instagram's public thumbnails aren't fetchable, so an Instagram `video` with no `poster` bullet falls back to a plain placeholder tile. Author a `poster` for a real still.
