# journey

> Native user-journey chart — sections of tasks, each tagged with actor(s) and a 1-5 mood. Renders as section bars, task chips, plumb lines, and mood faces.

**Function** progression · **Form** timeline · **Substance** structure

Use when a process or experience needs charting as a horizontal sequence of moments, each scored for affect. Five variants reshape the same source list: default (Mermaid-style classic), heatmap (mood-tinted chips), curve (mood polyline with axis), swimlane (per-actor rows), weighted (chip widths proportional to `+volume`).

## When to use

- **Affect is part of the story.** When a process matters not just for its steps but for how each step feels. The 1-5 mood score makes the emotional contour part of the chart instead of buried in narration.
- **Actors share the trail.** Use when multiple actors hand off through the sequence — customer, sales, onboarding, support. The `@actor` tokens make the handoff visible on every task chip.
- **One source, five lenses.** Author the journey once and re-render under any variant. Heatmap for fastest scan, curve for trend, swimlane for actor load, weighted for traffic-mix — same data, different argument.

## When NOT to use

- **Process without affect.** If the mood scores are all the same or arbitrary, the chart is doing less work than `timeline` or `list-steps`. Reserve journey for sequences where the affect changes meaningfully.
- **More than ten tasks.** Past ten tasks the chips compress and the labels become unreadable. Group into fewer sections, or split the journey at a natural break.
- **Volume tokens without weighted.** The `+N` volume token is meaningful only under the `weighted` variant. On the other four it is parsed but invisible — strip it from the markdown or commit to weighted.

## Authoring

```markdown
<!-- _class: journey -->

## Walking through my Tuesday morning.

- Wake up
  - Hit snooze `@me` `:2`
  - Make coffee `@me` `:4`
- Commute
  - Subway `@me` `:1`
  - Walk `@me` `:5`
- Work
  - Standup `@team` `:3`
  - Deep work `@me` `:5`
```

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `heading` | `h1, h2` | yes | Slide heading naming the journey or process. |
| `sections` | `ul > li` | yes | Top-level li per section. Lead with the section name; nested ul carries tasks. Each task carries inline-code tokens: `@actor` (one or more), `:N` mood 1-5, optional `+N` volume (used by .weighted). |

## Variants (layout-specific)

### `heatmap` — Heatmap — mood-tinted chips

Task chips are tinted by their mood score; plumb lines and faces are suppressed. The fastest variant to scan when the audience only needs to see which moments hurt.

```markdown
<!-- _class: journey heatmap -->

## Heatmap · where the trial drops off.

- Evaluate
  - Read case study `@prospect` `:5`
  - Book demo `@prospect` `:4`
- Trial
  - Trial signup `@prospect` `:3`
  - Workspace setup `@user` `:1`
- Activate
  - First report `@user` `:3`
  - Daily use `@user` `:5`
```

### `curve` — Curve — mood polyline with axis

Renders the mood scores as a polyline over the task sequence with a y-axis scale and section bands behind. Use when the trend across the journey is the headline.

```markdown
<!-- _class: journey curve -->

## Curve · the affect contour.

  - Daily use `@user` `:5`
```

### `swimlane` — Swimlane — per-actor rows

One row per actor; a dot marks every task that actor participates in, sized by that task's mood. Use when the question is who carries the journey and where the handoffs land.

```markdown
<!-- _class: journey swimlane -->

## Swimlane · who owns each moment.

- Evaluate
  - Read case study `@prospect` `:5`
  - Live demo `@prospect` `@sales` `:4`
- Trial
  - Trial signup `@prospect` `:3`
  - Workspace setup `@user` `@onboarding` `:1`
- Activate
  - First report `@user` `:3`
  - Daily use `@user` `:5`
```

### `weighted` — Weighted — chip widths by volume

Chip widths scale to the `+volume` token; chip colour still encodes mood. Two dimensions at once — schedule shape and traffic-mix — for journeys with skewed loads.

```markdown
<!-- _class: journey weighted -->

## Weighted · where the traffic actually lands.

- Discover
  - Search `@prospect` `:4` `+45`
  - Referral `@prospect` `:5` `+18`
- Convert
  - Pricing page `@prospect` `:3` `+12`
  - Checkout `@prospect` `:2` `+10`

  - Help docs `@user` `:4` `+7`
```

## Universal modifiers

This layout accepts all universal variants (`dark`, `compact`, `loose`, `accent`, state markers, treatments). See [reference/design-system.md §6.5](../../reference/design-system.md#65-universal-variants--three-tiers) for the catalog.

## Related components

- [`timeline`](../timeline/timeline.docs.md) — linear sequence without per-step mood or actors
- [`list-steps`](../list-steps/list-steps.docs.md) — process needs descriptive body per step, no chart
- [`gantt`](../gantt/gantt.docs.md) — schedule of overlapping tasks across lanes
- [`kanban`](../kanban/kanban.docs.md) — current status by stage rather than sequence over time
