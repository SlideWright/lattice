`Codebook architecture`

## How the codebook architecture arrived in production.

Four stages over eighteen months. Date pill leads each item; status pill trails.

1. `2024 Q3` Vault round-trip
   - First production tokenization shipped on a centralised vault. p99 60 ms.
2. `2025 Q1` Codebook proposal `decision`
   - Architecture review accepts the in-process model. Build approved.
3. `2025 Q3` Codebook GA `live`
   - Phase 1 rollout complete; 12 production tenants on the new path.
4. `2026 Q1` Multi-tenant DEKs `live`
   - Hardening shipped; codebook caching cut p99 below 5 ms.

## When NOT to reach for timeline-list.

- **Date-less steps.** If the items don't carry calendar dates, you have a sequence, not a timeline. Use `list-steps` for an ordered list or `journey` for stage-by-stage progress without a date axis.
- **Date-range bars.** If each milestone needs a start and an end on a shared time axis, the slide is a Gantt chart. Use `gantt` — the bar geometry will convey the durations the pill cannot.
- **Status pills as decoration.** The status pill is a verdict — `decision`, `live`, `at-risk`, `blocked`, `done`. Don't invent freeform tags; the engine only tints the recognised vocabulary, and decorative pills break the at-a-glance read.

- `gantt` — milestones occupy date ranges, not single moments
- `list-steps` — the sequence has no dates, just an order
- `journey` — stage-by-stage progress without calendar dates
- `roadmap` — the timeline is forward-looking and bucketed by horizon
- `progress` — the events are parallel workstreams with completion percentages
