# regulatory-update

> Change log against a baseline — numbered list of statutes/cases/rules with citation, summary, and effective date.

**Function** progression · **Form** ledger · **Substance** structure

**Tags** `changelog` · `compliance` · `regulation`

Use when a quarter's regulatory motion needs a single-slide digest. Each row carries the change name, the citation (inline code), the summary, and the effective-date marker (inline code).

## When to use

- **Period-bounded digest.** When a quarter or half of regulatory motion needs to land as a single scannable ledger. The audience sees what moved, when it took effect, and where to read it — without flipping through a multi-page memo.
- **Citation is the proof.** Each row anchors on its inline-code citation chip. Without the citation the row reads as opinion; with it, the row earns its place in a compliance brief.
- **Effective-date pill closes the row.** The trailing `Effective Mon YYYY` chip tells the audience whether the change is live, imminent, or final. The pill is the row's call-to-action signal.

## When NOT to use

- **Single rule's lineage.** If the slide walks one rule from statute through case, use `authority-chain`. regulatory-update is a period digest.
- **Past six rows.** More than six items compresses the row gap and the citation chips run out of room. Split by jurisdiction.
- **Missing summary or citation.** Each row needs all three sub-items — citation, summary, effective date. Otherwise the row reads as rumour.

## Variants (layout-specific)

### `timeline` — Timeline — chronological spine instead of ranked ledger

Renders the rows as a chronological spine — effective-date chips align on the right and the chrome reads as a calendar rather than a ranking. Use when chronology is the read, not weight.

```markdown
<!-- _class: regulatory-update timeline -->

### `priority` — Priority — ranked by exposure rather than chronology

```markdown
<!-- _class: regulatory-update priority -->
