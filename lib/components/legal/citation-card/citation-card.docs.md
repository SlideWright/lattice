# citation-card

> Single authoritative reference — heading + citation + verbatim quote + plain-English gloss.

**Function** evidence · **Form** canvas · **Substance** prose

Use when one citation IS the slide. The blockquote carries the verbatim language; the trailing list explains what it means and what we must do about it.

## When to use

- **One citation carries the slide.** When a single statute, contract clause, regulation, or standard is doing the argumentative work. The citation IS the evidence; the slide gives it the room to be read.
- **Verbatim language matters.** Reach for citation-card when the exact wording is load-bearing — definitions, scope clauses, exception language. The blockquote preserves the language unmodified so the gloss can interpret it.
- **Audience needs the 'so what'.** The gloss list translates legalese into plain English and names the concrete action. Without it the slide is a quotation; with it the slide is a decision.

## When NOT to use

- **Multiple citations on one slide.** If you are stacking two or three statutes, use statute-stack instead — citation-card is built for the canvas-weight treatment of a single authority.
- **Paraphrased 'quote'.** If you are rewriting the source language, drop the citation framing and use content or split-statement. The whole point of citation-card is verbatim language with attribution.
- **Gloss longer than the quote.** When the plain-English explanation runs three paragraphs, the citation is no longer the focus. Trim the gloss to one sentence plus a `What we must do` action, or move to content.

## Authoring

## Headline framing what this citation establishes.

`Citation reference · short name`

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `heading` | `h2` | yes | Slide heading framing what the citation establishes. |
| `citation` | `p:first-of-type > code` | yes | Inline-code paragraph with the citation reference (e.g. 'Cal. Civ. Code §1798.140(o) · CCPA/CPRA'). |
| `quotation` | `blockquote` | yes | Verbatim quote of the cited language. |
| `gloss` | `ul > li` | no | Optional plain-English interpretation. Use **What we must do** for the actionable item. |

## Variants (layout-specific)

### `pull-quote` — Pull-quote treatment

Promotes the blockquote to a pull-quote scale — the verbatim language reads as the headline; the gloss compresses to the actionable item.

```markdown
<!-- _class: citation-card pull-quote -->

## "Personal information" includes the household, not just the person.

`Cal. Civ. Code §1798.140(o) · CCPA/CPRA`

> Information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.

- What we must do.
  - Audit pixel inventory; treat household IDs as PI in DSAR workflows.
```

### `split` — Split — quote | gloss columns

Puts the verbatim quotation in the left column and the plain-English gloss in the right, with the citation spanning the top. Use when quote and interpretation deserve equal weight.

```markdown
<!-- _class: citation-card split -->

## CCPA defines "sale" broadly.

`Cal. Civ. Code §1798.140(ad) · CCPA/CPRA`

> "Sale" means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating a consumer's personal information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.

- The catch is "other valuable consideration."
  - Data-for-service swaps and ad-tech cookie syncs can qualify as sales even when no money changes hands.
```

### `margin` — Margin — annotated quotation

Sets the quotation as the body with the gloss running as margin notes alongside. Use for close reading where each clause earns its own annotation.

```markdown
<!-- _class: citation-card margin -->

## The GDPR lawful-basis test.

`GDPR Art. 6(1)(f) · legitimate interests`

> Processing is lawful only if and to the extent that processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights of the data subject.

- Two-part test.
  - Necessity first, then a balancing exercise against the data subject's rights. Document both halves or the basis fails on audit.
```

### `triptych` — Triptych — three panels

Frames the citation, the verbatim text, and the gloss as three panels for a formal presentation of a single authority. Keep the quotation short so it sits comfortably in its panel.

```markdown
<!-- _class: citation-card triptych -->

## What "personal data" covers under GDPR.

`GDPR Art. 4(1) · definitions`

> 'Personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

- Online identifiers count.
  - IP addresses, cookie IDs, and device fingerprints are personal data — scope your notice and retention accordingly.
```

## Universal modifiers

This layout accepts all universal variants (`dark`, `compact`, `loose`, `accent`, state markers, treatments). See [reference/design-system.md §6.5](../../reference/design-system.md#65-universal-variants--three-tiers) for the catalog.

## Related components

- [`statute-stack`](../statute-stack/statute-stack.docs.md) — two or three citations need to land on one slide
- [`quote`](../quote/quote.docs.md) — the source is a person, not a document
- [`split-statement`](../split-statement/split-statement.docs.md) — a quote with three or four implications
- [`content`](../content/content.docs.md) — the citation is one input among several in a prose argument
