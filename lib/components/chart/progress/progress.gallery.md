## When NOT to reach for progress.

- **Comparing unrelated metrics.** Revenue % of target, latency vs SLO, and headcount fill aren't comparable on a shared bar scale. Use `kpi` for value/target/status tiles or `stats` for an independent metric row.
- **More than eight rows.** Past eight workstreams the bars compress and the labels truncate. Split the view by owner or workstream group; the audience can't scan twelve bars at once anyway.
- **Decorative status pills.** Don't invent new status words for tone. `on-track`, `at-risk`, `blocked`, `deferred`, `done` are the vocabulary the engine recognises; everything else renders as a plain pill and breaks the at-a-glance read.

`Related components`

- `kpi` — value + target + status tiles, not a single percent
- `stats` — independent headline metrics, no completion scale
- `gantt` — the rows are time-bound and need a date axis
- `checklist` — binary done / not-done across a flat list
- `timeline-list` — the workstreams complete in sequence, not in parallel
