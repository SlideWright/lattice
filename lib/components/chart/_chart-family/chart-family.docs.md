# chart-family

Lattice's chart engine. A shared rendering subsystem used by thirteen
chart-class components: `progress`, `timeline-list`, `piechart`,
`gantt`, `kanban`, `radar`, `quadrant`, `state-chart`, `funnel`, `map`,
`journey`, `word-cloud`, and `roadmap`.

Membership is defined by the engine, not the disk bucket: a chart-family
member is any layout the dispatcher wraps in the `.chart-frame` skeleton.
That is a wider net than substance = `series` — `state-chart` is a `graph`
and `journey` is `structure`, yet both render through the frame, and
`word-cloud` (`series`) was folded in when its bespoke frame-mirroring CSS
was retired in favour of the real skeleton.

**Files in this folder:**

| File | What it implements |
|---|---|
| `chart-family.css` | The `.chart-frame` skeleton + `.chart-status` pill vocabulary that every chart component wraps its content in. |
| `chart-family.js` | The dispatcher + inline kernels for `progress` / `timeline-list` / `piechart` / `gantt` / `kanban`, plus shared parsing helpers. Imports the per-component `radar.transform` and `quadrant.transform` kernels which live in their own component folders. |

The dispatcher runs in both render paths:
- **The owned engine** (`lib/engine`) — wraps the
  `render()` output and post-processes the HTML string.
- **Emulator build path** (`lattice-emulator.js`) — calls the same
  dispatch inline during per-slide HTML construction.

## The `.chart-frame` skeleton

Every chart component renders into the same outer DOM shape:

```html
<section class="<layout> chart-frame">
  <div class="chart-header">
    <p class="chart-eyebrow"><code>…</code></p>
    <h2>Title.</h2>
    <p class="chart-subtitle"><code>…</code></p>
  </div>
  <div class="chart-body">
    <!-- layout-specific markup goes here -->
  </div>
  <p class="chart-caption">…</p>
</section>
```

The dispatcher does three things:
1. Recognizes the layout class on a section.
2. Wraps the section's content in `.chart-frame` / `.chart-header` /
   `.chart-body` / `.chart-caption`.
3. Rewrites the inner list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) into layout-specific
   markup by calling the kernel for that layout.

CSS in `chart-family.css` styles the skeleton (header padding, body
flex layout, status pill chrome). Per-component CSS in
`lib/components/<chart-layout>/<chart-layout>.styles.css` styles the
chart's interior.

## Legend / key system

A chart carries a **key** only when it encodes meaning by colour, symbol, or
size — i.e. something the marks don't already spell out. That test sorts the
13 members into three placements (full rationale + the per-chart catalog:
`engineering/decisions/2026-06-11-chart-legend-system.md`):

**Colour/size-categorical → integrated SVG key.** `piechart`, `radar`, `map`,
and `quadrant·cohort` carry their key **inside the diagram's own `<svg>`
viewBox**: diagram, a gradient **spine**, and the swatch+label+value key are one
unit that scales together (emitted by `svg-legend.js` — see
`engineering/decisions/2026-06-13-svg-native-legend.md`). No CSS grid, no
`::before` spine — the key is SVG `<text>`/`<rect>` in viewBox units, so it tracks
the diagram at any size and the four read as one family; long labels **wrap**
(never clip). `word-cloud` is the lone holdout: it still lays out as a CSS `grid`
(cloud in the left ~68%, a vertical "size = frequency" ramp in the right rail)
with a gradient **spine** drawn by `.word-cloud-canvas::after`, and it now
**solely owns the `--chart-spine*` tokens** the keyed charts used to share.

**Wide diagram → bottom-centre key.** `roadmap` (status markers ✓/–/○/╱,
emitted by `buildStatusLegend` for the states present; omitted only on
`status`, which already labels every cell), `gantt` (a swatch+label status key
reusing each bar's fill,
emitted by `buildGanttChart`), and `journey` (actor + mood keys reordered to
the foot of the board, CSS-only).

**Self-labelling → no key.** `funnel`, `progress`, `kanban`, `timeline-list`,
`state-chart`, and the non-cohort `quadrant` variants caption every
band/bar/card/node in place (kanban & state-chart print a labelled status
pill on each tile), so a separate key would be redundant.

The keyed charts' key carries only TYPE from CSS — `.chart-key-label` / `-value`
/ `-head` set fill + route `--font-label` / `--font-mono` (so the `sketch` finish
reskins the labels); the GEOMETRY lives in the SVG. The only CSS-rail tokens left
are `word-cloud`'s own `--chart-spine` / `--chart-spine-w` / `--chart-spine-h` (on
`section.word-cloud`). The roadmap/gantt/journey keys ride the shared
`transformChartSection`, adding no slides, so cross-renderer parity holds.

## Standalone export — one chart as a self-contained `.svg`

Because the four keyed charts are **one `<svg>`** (diagram + spine + key in a
single viewBox), a chart can be lifted out of a deck as a portable file. It is
not portable *as-emitted*, though: colours are `var(--token)`/`color-mix()` and
the key text is styled by `.chart-key-*` CSS classes, so a detached SVG with no
stylesheet renders **black, unstyled, serif**. The export resolves this:

- **`lib/components/chart/_chart-family/standalone-svg.js`** — the shared core.
  `flattenSvgStyles` walks the rendered chart and inlines the browser's
  **computed** paint/text styles as literals (so `var()`/`color-mix()` bake to
  `rgb()`/`oklab()` and no external CSS is needed); gradient `<stop>`s are
  resolved through a rendered probe (defs aren't laid out, so `getComputedStyle`
  won't resolve them there). `finalizeStandaloneSvg` then guarantees `xmlns`, a
  `viewBox`-derived intrinsic `width`/`height`, and injects the embedded fonts.
  `collectFontFamilies` subsets which faces to embed.
- **CLI — `tools/export-chart-svg.js`** (headless): `node tools/export-chart-svg.js
  <deck.md> [--slide N] [--chart I] [--theme NAME] [--mode light|dark]
  [-o out.svg] [--all]`. Renders through `window.LatticePlayground.render` in a
  puppeteer page, embeds the engine fonts from disk
  (`tools/lib/chart-font-embed.js`), writes the file.
- **Drawing Board** — a **"Chart SVG"** entry in the Export menu, shown **only
  when the cursor's slide carries a chart** (gated on the `.db-active` section),
  exporting that one chart. Reuses the same core in the browser via the esbuild
  ESM bundle `standalone-svg.generated.js`, embedding fonts through
  `docs/src/playground/font-embed.js`.

**Caveats.** Resolved colours come out as `oklab()` where the source used
`color-mix(in oklab, …)` — every current browser (and Inkscape ≥1.0 / resvg)
renders it, older SVG renderers may not. The export keeps a `viewBox`, so it
stays fully responsive (the intrinsic `width`/`height` is only a default
footprint). Embed-only — text stays selectable; glyph **outlining** to `<path>`
was deferred (`2026-06-13-svg-native-legend.md` §4d).

## Membership

The closed set of layouts wrapped by chart-family is hard-coded in
`chart-family.js`:

```js
const CHART_LAYOUTS = ['progress', 'timeline-list', 'piechart',
                       'gantt', 'kanban', 'radar', 'quadrant',
                       'state-chart', 'funnel', 'map',
                       'journey', 'word-cloud', 'roadmap'];
```

Adding a new chart member requires updating that array AND either:
- writing an inline builder in `chart-family.js` (current pattern for
  `progress` / `timeline-list` / `piechart` / `gantt` / `kanban`), OR
- writing a per-component `<name>.transform.js` kernel and importing
  it from `chart-family.js` (current pattern for `radar`, `quadrant`,
  `state-chart`, `funnel`, `map`, `journey`, `word-cloud`, and `roadmap`).

`roadmap` is the one member whose body is a `<table>` (or a transposed
`.horizons` grid) rather than a list/SVG figure; the dispatch wraps it in a
`.roadmap-figure` div so the div-based chart-frame body matcher catches it.

For a delegated kernel the dispatch branch calls the kernel's section
transform to rewrite the list in place (e.g.
`journey.transformJourneySection(html, cls)` /
`wordCloud.transformWordCloudSection(html, cls)`), leaving the `<h2>` for
the chart-frame wrap to lift into the header. The body container the kernel
emits (`.journey-board`, `.word-cloud-canvas`, …) must be listed in the
`bodyRE` the wrap scans for.

---

## Kernel contract

Per-component chart kernels (`radar.transform.js`, `quadrant.transform.js`)
export `transformChartSection(html, classTokens)` — a pure function
that takes the raw section HTML and the section's class tokens, returns
the rewritten HTML.

The same function signature is used by inline builders in
`chart-family.js`. The dispatcher routes based on class token presence
and calls the appropriate kernel.

---

## Three-renderer parity

The dispatcher runs identically in three places:

| Render path | Where the dispatch is called |
|---|---|
| Engine (HTML) | `lib/engine` → `applyChartFamilyToHtml(html)` |
| Lattice emulator | `lattice-emulator.js` → inline `transformChartSection()` calls per slide |
| VS Code preview | `lattice-runtime.js` → DOM mirror that recreates the same wrappers at runtime |

Editorial guarantee: every chart slide renders identically across the
three paths. Drift between them is a bug; the per-component
integration tests at `test/integration/components/component-galleries.test.js`
assert page counts to catch transforms that silently change topology.

---

## Why HTML-string transforms, not markdown-it rules

The transform is structural (extract eyebrow before h2, subtitle after
h2, caption italic at the tail, rewrite the list into chart-specific
markup) and easier to express on rendered HTML than on the token
stream. The owned engine wraps `render` and
post-processes the resulting `html` string.

Why not a runtime `<script>`? VS Code Marp preview filters HTML
elements through Marp's allowlist, which excludes `<script>` by
default. Even with `markdown.marp.html: "all"`, relative-path
resolution and webview CSP made the runtime path unreliable. The
engine wrapper bakes the transform into the rendered HTML so the
preview and the export pipelines see the same DOM.

---

## Future refactor

The current file structure has an asymmetry: `radar` and `quadrant`
follow the per-component-transform pattern (their kernels live in
`lib/components/<name>/<name>.transform.js`), while the other 5 chart
layouts have their kernels inlined in `chart-family.js`. This was
historical — the inline kernels were written before per-component
transforms were a pattern.

A planned cleanup distributes all kernels to their components, leaving
`chart-family.js` as pure dispatch + shared helpers. See
`engineering/decisions/2026-05-17-chart-family-refactor.md` for the design.
