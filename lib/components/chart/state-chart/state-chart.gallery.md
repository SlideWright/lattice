## When NOT to reach for state-chart.

- **More than ~8 states.** Vertical stacks of ten or more states stop reading as a machine and start reading as a list. If the system has many states, group them into phases and show one phase at a time, or step back to a higher-level abstraction. The chart's job is to make the topology obvious in one glance.
- **Hierarchical or parallel states.** v1 grammar is one flat list of states with one outgoing arrow per nested bullet. Composite states, orthogonal regions, history nodes — anything Mermaid's `stateDiagram-v2` does and this layout doesn't — belong in a Mermaid fence via the `diagram` component.
- **Continuous processes.** If the diagram is really a workflow with stages that overlap or block (queue depth, throughput, capacity), a `gantt` or `kanban` chart reads better. State charts are for discrete, mutually-exclusive states the system flips between.

`Related components`

- `diagram` — the machine has hierarchical states, parallel regions, or guards that need Mermaid's full state-diagram grammar
- `journey` — the sequence is a user's path through tasks with mood / affect, not a system's discrete states
- `timeline-list` — events are points in time rather than transitions between named states
- `list-steps` — a linear procedure with no branching — state-chart is overkill if there are no choices to make
- `roadmap` — parallel workstreams across phases, not a single machine's transitions
