## When NOT to reach for gantt.

- **Single workstream.** One lane of bars is a timeline, not a gantt. Use `timeline` or `list-steps` when there is no parallel work to coordinate.
- **More than five lanes.** Past five workstreams the bars compress and the labels crowd. Group lanes (collapse 'SDK' subdomains into 'SDK') or split into two slides.
- **No spans.** If tasks are point-in-time milestones rather than durations, use `timeline` or `roadmap milestones`. gantt earns its chrome only when bars have meaningful length.
