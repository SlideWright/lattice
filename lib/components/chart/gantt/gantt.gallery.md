`2026 Q1 .. 2026 Q4` `today Q3`

## What ships in each phase, by workstream.

Three workstreams across four quarters; the one at-risk bar quietly gates the rollout, GA is a milestone, and the today line marks where the plan stands.

## When NOT to reach for gantt.

- **Single workstream.** One lane of bars is a timeline, not a gantt. Use `timeline` or `list-steps` when there is no parallel work to coordinate.
- **More than five lanes.** Past five workstreams the bars compress and the labels crowd. Group lanes (collapse 'SDK' subdomains into 'SDK') or split into two slides.
- **No spans at all.** A gantt mixes bars with the odd milestone — but if every task is a point-in-time event with no durations, use `timeline` or `roadmap milestones`. gantt earns its chrome only when bars carry meaningful length.
