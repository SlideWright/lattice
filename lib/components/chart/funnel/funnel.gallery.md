# funnel

`Evidence · Canvas · Series`

Tapering stages that show where a flow drops off, with the conversion rate between each.

## When NOT to reach for funnel.

- **Stages that aren't a subset.** If a later stage can exceed an earlier one (it's a category breakdown, not a pipeline), the taper lies. Use `piechart` for parts of a whole or `progress` for independent metrics.
- **A funnel of two stages.** Two bands is a single conversion rate dressed up as a chart. State it as a `big-number` (‘18% convert’) or a two-tile `stats` instead.
- **Non-monotonic values.** Values that rise and fall make the trapezoids bulge and the conversion %s read oddly. A funnel assumes a monotonic narrowing; for an up-and-down series use a `progress` or a chart with an axis.

`Related components`

- `progress` — independent metrics as labelled bars, not a narrowing pipeline
- `stats` — a row of headline figures with no drop-off relationship
- `piechart` — parts of a single whole rather than sequential stages
- `list-steps` — the stages are a process to walk through, not values to compare
- `big-number` — a single conversion rate is the whole story
