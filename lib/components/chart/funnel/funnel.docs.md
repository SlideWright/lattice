# funnel

> Tapering stages that show where a flow drops off, with the conversion rate between each.

**Function** evidence · **Form** canvas · **Substance** series

**Tags** `percentage` · `sequence` · `pitch`

Use for a pipeline that narrows — a sales / conversion funnel, a hiring or grant pipeline, an onboarding flow. Each stage's band width is proportional to its value; the stage-to-stage conversion % is printed in the gaps so the leak is the read.

## When to use

- **The story is the drop-off.** A funnel earns its shape when each stage is a strict subset of the one above and the audience needs to see WHERE the flow narrows — the leaky step, not just the totals. If the stages aren't a shrinking pipeline, use `progress` or `stats`.
- **Three to seven stages.** Two stages is just a ratio (use `big-number` or `stats`); past seven the bands thin out and the conversion labels crowd. Most pipelines fit in four to six.
- **Values in flow order, widest first.** Author the stages top-to-bottom as the flow runs, largest count first. The widest value sets full width and every band scales to it; the conversion % is computed from each value to the next.

## When NOT to use

- **Stages that aren't a subset.** If a later stage can exceed an earlier one (it's a category breakdown, not a pipeline), the taper lies. Use `piechart` for parts of a whole or `progress` for independent metrics.
- **A funnel of two stages.** Two bands is a single conversion rate dressed up as a chart. State it as a `big-number` (‘18% convert’) or a two-tile `stats` instead.
- **Non-monotonic values.** Values that rise and fall make the trapezoids bulge and the conversion %s read oddly. A funnel assumes a monotonic narrowing; for an up-and-down series use a `progress` or a chart with an axis.

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `h2` | yes | Slide heading — name the flow and, ideally, the takeaway (‘Where the pipeline leaks’). |
| `stages` | `ul > li` | yes | One li per stage, in flow order (widest first). Lead with the stage label, then a trailing inline-code value — `Signups \`4,800\``. Commas and units are tolerated; the largest value sets full width. Three to seven stages read best. |
| `detail` | `li > ul` | no | Optional nested sublist under a stage. Drives two surfaces from one source (shared with pie/map/quadrant via the chart-family mark-detail substrate): (1) Present/Practice — the kernel tags the stage `<polygon>` with `data-mark` and emits the sublist as an inert `<template class="chart-detail">` the reveal layer reads; (2) the static PDF — the same detail is folded into the slide's speaker note (`Label (value): item · item`) as a Marp-faithful comment that notes-core lifts into the per-slide note channel. The note rides the existing channel, so the chart pixels stay byte-identical. A funnel with no sublists emits no note and is unchanged. |

## Universal modifiers

This layout accepts all universal variants (`dark`, `compact`, `loose`, `accent`, state markers, treatments). See [design/design-system.md §6.5](../../../../design/design-system.md#65-universal-variants--three-tiers) for the catalog.

## Related components

- [`progress`](../../chart/progress/progress.docs.md) — independent metrics as labelled bars, not a narrowing pipeline
- [`stats`](../../evidence/stats/stats.docs.md) — a row of headline figures with no drop-off relationship
- [`piechart`](../../chart/piechart/piechart.docs.md) — parts of a single whole rather than sequential stages
- [`list-steps`](../../progression/list-steps/list-steps.docs.md) — the stages are a process to walk through, not values to compare
- [`big-number`](../../statement/big-number/big-number.docs.md) — a single conversion rate is the whole story
