# logo-wall

> A grid of customer, partner, or funder logos as social proof.

**Function** inventory · **Form** grid · **Substance** prose

**Tags** `visual` · `showcase` · `pitch`

Use for the credibility slide — the 'trusted by' / 'our funders' / 'participating agencies' wall. Marks render as token-coloured silhouettes (a CSS mask filled with `var(--logo-ink)`), so the wall is one cohesive texture that re-tones per theme and colour-mode and stays AA on any ground; the `color` variant gives each mark its own categorical palette hue.

## When to use

- **The proof is the logos.** Customers, partners, funders, accreditations, participating agencies — anywhere a set of recognisable marks carries more weight than a sentence. The audience scans the wall and concludes 'serious company keeps this company.'
- **Marks read as one texture.** Every mark is filled with the same palette token, so a loud red logo can't outshout a quiet one — the wall reads as a single credential, not a ransom note of competing brand colours. Because the fill is a token, it re-tones for theme + dark mode and stays AA on any ground.
- **Eight to eighteen marks.** Enough to signal breadth, few enough that each is legible. Fewer than six looks thin; past eighteen the marks shrink below recognition — curate to the most recognisable names or split across two slides.

## When NOT to use

- **Names that need a sentence.** If each entity needs a role, a quote, or a metric beside it, this is the wrong layout. Use `actors` (who owns what), `cards-grid` (a short body per item), or `quote` (a single testimonial).
- **Logos nobody recognises.** A wall of unknown marks proves nothing and asks the audience to squint. If the names don't carry on sight, state the count as a `big-number` ('400+ teams') instead.
- **Mismatched raster art.** The mark is rendered as a silhouette (a CSS mask / inline SVG), so it must be clean vector with real transparency — a raster PNG or a logo whose negative space is a white fill won't read. Source SVG marks drawn as filled shapes; colour is supplied by the palette token, not the file.

## Authoring

```markdown
<!-- _class: logo-wall -->

`Trusted by`

## The headline claim the logos back up.

- ![First brand](logo-1.svg)
  - First brand
  - `Series B`
- ![Second brand](logo-2.svg)
  - Second brand
- ![Third brand](logo-3.svg)
- ![Fourth brand](logo-4.svg)
- ![Fifth brand](logo-5.svg)
- ![Sixth brand](logo-6.svg)
```

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `eyebrow` | `p > code:only-child` | no | Optional kicker above the headline — wrap a short label in backticks, e.g. `Trusted by`. |
| `title` | `h2` | no | Optional headline above the wall. A claim earns its place (‘400+ teams run board prep on Lattice’); a bare label (‘Customers’) does not. |
| `logos` | `ul > li` | yes | One list item per mark, authored as `- ![Brand name](brand.svg)`. The alt text is the accessible label, not a rendered caption. SVG is preferred so marks stay crisp at projector scale. |
| `caption` | `ul > li > ul > li` | no | Optional name + pill stacked below a mark, centred. Nest a list under the image: plain text is the name, a backticked token (`Series B`) is the pill. Either or both, per mark. |

## Variants (component-specific)

### `color` — Color — per-mark palette hues

Gives each mark its own categorical palette hue (`--cat-*-mark`, cycling 1..12) instead of the single muted token — useful when telling the marks apart matters more than restraint, e.g. a partner directory. The hues are ours, so they stay cohesive with the deck's charts and AA on both grounds; the single-token default is the boardroom-restrained pick.

`Our partners`

## The brands behind the programme.

- ![Acme](acme.svg)
- ![Globex](globex.svg)
- ![Initech](initech.svg)
- ![Umbra](umbra.svg)
- ![Vantage](vantage.svg)
- ![Meridian](meridian.svg)
- ![Helios](helios.svg)
- ![Northwind](northwind.svg)
```

### `dense` — Dense — more marks, smaller cells

Tightens to six columns with shorter cells for a longer roster — a member directory, a full funder list, every participating agency. Past about eighteen marks the recognition threshold gives out; split across two slides instead.

## Universal modifiers

This component accepts all universal variants (`dark`, `compact`, `loose`, `accent`, state markers, treatments). See [design/design-system.md §6.5](../../../../design/design-system.md#65-universal-variants--three-tiers) for the catalog.

## Related components

- [`actors`](../../inventory/actors/actors.docs.md) — each named entity owns a responsibility, not just lends its logo
- [`cards-grid`](../../inventory/cards-grid/cards-grid.docs.md) — each item needs a line of body text, not just a mark
- [`big-number`](../../statement/big-number/big-number.docs.md) — the proof is a count ('400+ teams'), not the individual marks
- [`quote`](../../statement/quote/quote.docs.md) — one customer's testimonial carries the slide
- [`image`](../../imagery/image/image.docs.md) — a single visual, not a grid of marks, is the evidence

## Demo deck
