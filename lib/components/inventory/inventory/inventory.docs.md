# inventory

> A parallel set of related items of similar weight — one content shape, four interchangeable looks.

**Function** inventory · **Form** ledger · **Substance** structure

**Tags** `overview` · `summary` · `showcase`

**Capacity** ~4 items (crowds past 5, overflows past 6) — past that, list-tabular / split across slides.

**Density** up to ~14 words per item (overflows past 22) — one clause of body per part.

Use for a small register of related items where each carries similar weight. Author the content once (a bold lead + detail per item, optional trailing insight) and pick the look with a variant: the default numbered ledger, a cards grid, a horizontal timeline, or a magazine-style editorial split — no re-authoring. For more than six items, escalate to list-tabular or split across slides.

## When to use

- **A parallel register.** Two to six related items of similar weight — a framework's parts, a set of principles, the moving pieces of a system.
- **One content, your choice of look.** Write the items once; switch the variant to re-render the same content as a ledger, cards, timeline, or editorial split — no re-authoring.
- **A bold lead per item.** Each entry reads as a short bold name followed by a one-sentence detail. Equal density across entries keeps every look balanced.
- **An optional closing insight.** A trailing blockquote becomes the look's accent — a band, a pull-quote, a kicker, or a sidebar.

## When NOT to use

- **More than six items.** The looks lose scannability past six entries (the cards/timeline looks past four). Escalate to list-tabular or split across slides.
- **Ordered steps.** If sequence carries meaning, use list-steps or list-criteria. inventory entries are parallel, of similar weight.
- **Nested-bullet authoring.** inventory takes an inline bold lead (`- **Lead.** detail`), not the nested `- Title` / `  - body` shape that card-style components use.
- **Lopsided density.** Equalize the prose when one entry has three sentences and the rest have one — uneven density unbalances every look.

## Authoring

```markdown
<!-- _class: inventory -->

`Eyebrow`

## Slide heading.

- **First entry.** One-sentence description.
- **Second entry.** One-sentence description.
- **Third entry.** One-sentence description.
- **Fourth entry.** One-sentence description.

> Optional trailing insight.
```

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `eyebrow` | `p:first-child > code` | no | Optional kicker above the title (lifts into the masthead band under Form). |
| `title` | `h2` | yes | Slide heading. |
| `items` | `ul > li` | yes | Each list item is one entry, authored as `- **Lead.** detail sentence.` — the bold lead is the entry name, the rest is its description. |
| `insight` | `blockquote` | no | Optional trailing insight or takeaway. Renders as an accent band (ledger), a centred pull-quote (cards), a kicker above the run (timeline), or an accent-ruled sidebar (editorial). |

## Variants (component-specific)

### `cards` — Cards

The same register as an equal grid of cards, with the insight as a centred pull-quote. Best when the items read as parallel options scanned at a glance.

```markdown
<!-- _class: inventory cards -->

`Framework · Four Components`

## The system has four moving parts.

- **Signal Intake.** Weekly structured collection across conversations and market data.
- **Scoring Model.** Each signal scored on confidence, recency, and relevance.
- **Decision Log.** Every call recorded with the signals that informed it.
- **Calibration Loop.** Outcomes compared to predictions each cycle.

> Signals without decisions are just noise.
```

### `timeline` — Timeline

A horizontal numbered run with connectors, the insight as a kicker above. Reads the register as a left-to-right progression.

```markdown
<!-- _class: inventory timeline -->

### `editorial` — Editorial

A magazine split — the insight as an accent-ruled sidebar beside a ruled item column (the title rides the masthead band). For a feature-statement register.

<!-- _class: inventory editorial -->

## Universal modifiers

This component accepts all universal variants (`dark`, `compact`, `loose`, `accent`, state markers, treatments). See [design/design-system.md §6.5](../../../../design/design-system.md#65-universal-variants--three-tiers) for the catalog.

## Related components

- [`cards-grid`](../../inventory/cards-grid/cards-grid.docs.md) — you want a fixed cards grid with nested-bullet authoring
- [`list-steps`](../../progression/list-steps/list-steps.docs.md) — the items carry an explicit sequence
- [`list-tabular`](../../inventory/list-tabular/list-tabular.docs.md) — more than six rows, or a meta column per row
- [`timeline-list`](../../chart/timeline-list/timeline-list.docs.md) — a vertical dated timeline rather than a parallel register

## Demo deck

See [inventory.gallery.light.pdf](./inventory.gallery.light.pdf) for rendered examples of every variant.
