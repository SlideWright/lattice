> A network join card: readable Wi-Fi credentials beside a QR a phone scans to connect in one tap.

**Function** statement · **Form** panel · **Substance** structure

**Tags** `reference` · `onboarding` · `kickoff`

Use to get a room onto the Wi-Fi without reading a password aloud. The QR encodes the standard WIFI: payload; the same details render legibly for anyone typing them by hand. Author the fields as a postfix-key list.

## When to use

- **Get the room connected.** Guests scan to join instead of squinting at a password on the slide — the credentials are still shown for anyone who prefers to type.
- **Open networks are one field short.** Drop the password bullet and the card renders an open network; the QR encodes it as `nopass`.

## When NOT to use

- **Not for secrets that outlive the room.** A rendered deck is persistent and shareable. Use it for guest/offsite networks, not for credentials that must not leak.
- **Don't bold the field values.** The value leads and the key is a trailing inline-code tag — `- Offsite-Guest `ssid``. Don't write `- **SSID:** Offsite-Guest`; the transform reads the postfix key, not a bold label.

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `h2` | yes | The card heading (e.g. "Join the room."). |
| `fields` | `ul > li` | yes | One field per bullet in postfix-key form — value first, trailing inline-code names the field: `- Offsite-Guest `ssid``. Keys: ssid\|network (required), password\|pass, security\|auth. Omit the password for an open network. |

## Universal modifiers

This component accepts all universal variants (`dark`, `compact`, `loose`, `accent`, state markers, treatments). See [design/design-system.md §6.5](../../../../design/design-system.md#65-universal-variants--three-tiers) for the catalog.
