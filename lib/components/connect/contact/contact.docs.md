# contact

> An identity card that encodes a vCard: name, title and contact lines beside a QR that saves the presenter to a phone.

**Function** statement · **Form** panel · **Substance** structure

**Tags** `reference` · `onboarding` · `kickoff`

Use as the "scan to add me" close or a speaker-intro slide. The QR encodes a vCard the audience saves in one tap; the card shows the name as hero with title/org and a contact ledger. Author the fields as a postfix-key list.

## When to use

- **The scan-to-add-me close.** End a pitch or intro with a code the audience scans to save your contact, instead of trading business cards.
- **Show what you choose, encode the rest.** Every non-empty field goes into the vCard; the card foregrounds the name, title and org and lists email/phone/url beneath.

## When NOT to use

- **Not a team roster.** One card is one person. For a set of people use an inventory layout; a contact card is a single identity.
- **Don't bold the field values.** The value leads and the key is a trailing inline-code tag — `- Sharmarke Aden `name``. Don't write `- **Name:** Sharmarke Aden`; the transform reads the postfix key, not a bold label.

## Authoring

```markdown
<!-- _class: contact -->

## Add me.

- Full Name `name`
- Title `title`
- Organization `org`
- name@example.com `email`
```

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `h2` | no | Optional framing heading; the person's name is the visual hero, drawn from the `name` field. |
| `fields` | `ul > li` | yes | One field per bullet in postfix-key form — value first, trailing inline-code names the field: `- Sharmarke Aden `name``. Keys: name (required), title\|role, org\|company, email, phone\|tel, url\|web. |
