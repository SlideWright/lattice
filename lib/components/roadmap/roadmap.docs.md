# roadmap

> Phased multi-workstream grid — phases across the top, workstreams down the side.

**Function** progression · **Form** matrix · **Substance** structure

Use to show what ships in each phase across multiple parallel workstreams. Cells render as state-token discs (pass/warn/fail/skip).

## When to use

- **Phased delivery across workstreams.** When the question is what each team ships in each phase. Workstreams down the side, phases across the top, deliverables in the cells — the whole plan reads in one glance.
- **State markers are the second channel.** Every cell can lead with `[x]` shipped, `[-]` in flight, `[ ]` planned, or `[/]` out of scope. The audience sees both 'what' and 'how it's going' without a separate status slide.
- **Phase headers carry meta pills.** Append `` `Q2 2026` `` to a phase header and the renderer anchors a meta pill on the right of the column. Use it for date, owner, or status tags that frame the phase.

## When NOT to use

- **One workstream.** A single row of phases is a `timeline` or `list-steps`, not a roadmap. Roadmap earns its grid only when at least two workstreams move in parallel.
- **No state markers.** A grid of bare deliverables loses half its value. Add `[x]`/`[-]`/`[ ]`/`[/]` so the audience reads progress alongside scope.
- **Past five workstreams.** More than five rows compresses cell text and the lane stripes lose their categorical read. Group adjacent workstreams or split by phase.

## What ships in each phase, by workstream.

| Workstream | Foundation `Q2 2026`  | Hardening `Q3 2026`    | Scale `Q4 2026`           |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Platform   | [x] Codebook signing  | [-] Multi-tenant DEKs  | [ ] Per-purpose codebooks |
| Operations | [x] Manual rotation   | [-] Automated rotation | [ ] Crypto-shred          |
| Compliance | [x] Audit trail       | [x] Centralised log    | [ ] Examiner pack         |
| SDK        | [x] Java              | [/] .NET               | [ ] Polyglot parity       |

State markers `[x]/[-]/[ ]/[/]` are universal: ✓ shipped, ◐ in flight, ○ planned, ╱ out of scope.
```

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `h2` | yes | Slide heading naming the plan. |
| `rows` | `ul > li` | yes | Outer li per workstream, lead with **Workstream.**. Inner bullets per phase, marked [x]/[-]/[ ]/[/] then the deliverable. |

## Variants (layout-specific)

### `horizons` — Horizons — three-horizon planning framing

Tints the phase columns as Horizon 1 / 2 / 3 (now / next / later) per the McKinsey three-horizons framing. Use when the planning frame is strategic-horizon-aware rather than fiscal-quarter-aware.

## Where the platform invests across horizons.

| Workstream | Horizon 1 `Now`          | Horizon 2 `Next`         | Horizon 3 `Later`         |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Platform   | [x] Codebook signing     | [-] Multi-tenant DEKs    | [ ] Per-purpose codebooks |
| Operations | [x] Manual rotation      | [-] Automated rotation   | [ ] Crypto-shred          |
| Compliance | [x] Audit trail          | [x] Centralised log      | [ ] Examiner pack         |
| SDK        | [x] Java                 | [/] .NET                 | [ ] Polyglot parity       |

Horizons frame the read: H1 is core business, H2 is emerging, H3 is the option set.

## Universal modifiers

This layout accepts all universal variants (`dark`, `compact`, `loose`, `accent`, state markers, decoration backgrounds). See [docs/design-system.md §6.5](../../docs/design-system.md#65-universal-variants--three-tiers) for the catalog.

- [`gantt`](../gantt/gantt.docs.md) — continuous task bars across a date axis rather than discrete phase cells
- [`kanban`](../kanban/kanban.docs.md) — current state by stage rather than phased schedule
- [`list-steps`](../list-steps/list-steps.docs.md) — single workstream sequence without parallel lanes
- [`verdict-grid`](../verdict-grid/verdict-grid.docs.md) — options scored against shared criteria, not phased delivery
- [`checklist`](../checklist/checklist.docs.md) — single list with state markers, no workstream dimension
