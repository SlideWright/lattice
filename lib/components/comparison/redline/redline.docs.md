# redline

> Clause-by-clause comparison — verbatim language with inline <ins>/<del> tracking the amendment.

**Function** comparison · **Form** canvas · **Substance** prose

Use when an amendment's diff is the slide. The blockquote carries the redlined text with ins/del markers; the trailing list explains why the diff matters operationally.

## When to use

- **Verbatim text matters.** When the amendment is the language — legal clauses, regulatory paragraphs, contract terms. Paraphrasing would lose the exact words the parties are bound by.
- **Diff is the slide.** The inline `<ins>` and `<del>` markers are the editorial argument. The audience reads what changed by scanning the green and red inline marks, not by toggling between two blocks.
- **Why-this-matters trailer.** End with a single operational sentence explaining what the diff means for the team's work. The clause is the evidence; the trailer is the implication.

## When NOT to use

- **Code diffs.** For two code snippets side-by-side, use `compare-code`. redline is for natural language — legal, regulatory, contractual — not source code.
- **Paraphrased clauses.** If the quoted text isn't verbatim, the diff is meaningless. Either render the actual clause with its diff, or move to `compare-prose` for narrative comparison.
- **Long passage with one tiny diff.** If one word changed in a paragraph, quote only the affected sentence or two. A wall of unchanged text with one inline mark buries the change.

## Headline naming the amendment.

`Citation reference · amendment name (year)`

> Verbatim language with <del>old wording</del> <ins>new wording</ins> inline so the diff reads cleanly.

- **Why this matters.** What the amendment changes in operational terms, in one sentence.
```

## Slots

| Slot | Selector | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `heading` | `h2` | yes | Slide heading naming the amendment or change. |
| `citation` | `p:first-of-type > code` | yes | Inline-code citation of the amended provision (e.g. 'Cal. Civ. Code §1798.135 · SB-362 (2024)'). |
| `redline` | `blockquote` | yes | The amended language. Use <del>old text</del> and <ins>new text</ins> inline. |
| `implications` | `ul > li` | no | Optional explanation. Use **Why this matters** for the operational read. |

## Variants (layout-specific)

### `annotated` — Annotated — numbered margin notes

Adds numbered sup markers in the quoted passage and renders the trailing list as numbered annotations. Use when the diff has several distinct changes that each need their own reviewer rationale.

```markdown
<!-- _class: redline annotated -->

## SB-362 rewrote the opt-out link rule — annotated.

`Cal. Civ. Code §1798.135 · amendment SB-362 (2024)`

> A business that <del>collects</del> <ins>collects, sells, or shares</ins><sup>1</sup> consumers' personal information shall provide <del>two or more</del> <ins>at least one</ins><sup>2</sup> designated method for submitting requests to opt-out, <ins>including, at minimum, a clear and conspicuous link on the homepage titled "Your Privacy Choices,"</ins><sup>3</sup> for use by consumers.

- **Scope expansion.** Collapses sale and sharing into one duty.
- **Method floor.** One method is now sufficient; previously two were required.
- **Link mandate.** Pins a uniform link title across all businesses.
```

### `three-col` — Three-col — old | new | rationale

Splits the passage into three columns: prior text on the left, new text in the middle, reviewer rationale on the right. Use when both the diff and the why need to be on-screen together.

```markdown
<!-- _class: redline three-col -->

## SB-362 — old, new, and why side-by-side.

`Cal. Civ. Code §1798.135 · amendment SB-362 (2024)`

> A business that collects consumers' personal information shall provide two or more designated methods for submitting requests to opt out of the sale of their personal information.

> A business that collects, sells, or shares consumers' personal information shall provide at least one designated method for submitting requests to opt-out, including a clear and conspicuous homepage link titled "Your Privacy Choices," for use by consumers to direct the business not to sell or share their personal information.

- **Scope.** Sale and sharing fold into one duty.
- **Method floor.** One method now suffices.
- **Link title.** Homepage label is mandatory and standardised.
```

- [`compare-code`](../compare-code/compare-code.docs.md) — the diff is source code, not natural language
- [`compare-prose`](../compare-prose/compare-prose.docs.md) — two narrative alternatives, not verbatim amendments
- [`before-after`](../before-after/before-after.docs.md) — the change is structural state, not text
- [`obligation-matrix`](../obligation-matrix/obligation-matrix.docs.md) — comparing many regimes against shared obligations
