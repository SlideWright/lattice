# Every Mermaid diagram, one slide each.

`Mermaid 11.14 · Lattice Theme`

*A reference gallery of the 26 diagram types Mermaid supports, rendered with the Lattice palette so you can see what each one looks like in production.*

<!-- _class: split-panel watermark -->

## How this gallery is organised.

`Orientation · How to use this deck`

### Three groups, twenty-six diagrams

Stable diagrams render with full theme control. Experimental ones marked 🔥 may evolve in syntax and have limited theming surfaces.

- **15**
  - **Stable**
  - Flowchart, sequence, class, state, ER, journey, gantt, pie, quadrant, requirement, gitgraph, c4, mindmap, timeline, zenuml.
- **11**
  - **Experimental 🔥**
  - Sankey, xy chart, block, packet, kanban, architecture, radar, treemap, venn, ishikawa, treeView.
- **6**
  - **Themeable**
  - Flowchart, sequence, pie, state, class, journey have named themeVariables. Everything else inherits from the core six.

`Group 01 · Stable diagrams`

## The fifteen well-supported types.

---

<!-- _class: diagram -->

`01 · Flowchart`

## Boxes and arrows. The most-used diagram type.

```mermaid
---
title: Signal pipeline
---
flowchart LR
  A{{"Signal Intake"}} --> B(["Scoring Model"])
  B -->|"scored signal"| C["Decision Log"]
  C -->|"decide / close"| D[("Outcome Store")]
  B -.->|"recalibration"| C
```

> Full theme support — node fills, borders, edge colors, cluster fills, edge labels all controllable via themeVariables.

---

<!-- _class: diagram -->

`02 · Sequence Diagram`

## Actors and signals over time.

```mermaid
---
title: Score-and-decide sequence
---
sequenceDiagram
  participant App
  participant SDK
  participant Store
  App->>SDK: score(signal)
  SDK->>SDK: apply weights
  SDK->>Store: load team weights
  Store-->>SDK: calibrated weights
  SDK-->>App: a score
  Note over SDK: decision logged on close
```

> Full theme support — actor backgrounds, signal colors, activation bars, note styling all themeable.

---

<!-- _class: diagram -->

`03 · Class Diagram`

## UML classes with attributes, methods, and inheritance.

```mermaid
---
title: Decision framework class model
---
classDiagram
  class DecisionFramework {
    -ScoringPolicy policy
    -TeamWeights weights
    +score(field, signal) Score
    +decide(field, score, criteria) Outcome
  }
  class ScoringPolicy {
    +String teamId
    +int version
    +verify() boolean
  }
  class TeamWeights {
    -float[] weights
    +recalibrate() void
  }
  DecisionFramework *-- ScoringPolicy
  DecisionFramework *-- TeamWeights
```

> Themeable — `classText` controls label color; node fills inherit from `primaryColor`.

---

<!-- _class: diagram -->

`04 · State Diagram`

## A finite state machine.

```mermaid
---
title: Approval state machine
---
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Draft
  Draft --> Submitted: submit
  Submitted --> Approved: approve
  Submitted --> Rejected: reject
  Approved --> [*]
  Rejected --> Draft: revise
  Rejected --> [*]: withdraw
```

> Themeable — `labelColor` and `altBackground` for composite states. State fills inherit from primary.

---

<!-- _class: diagram -->

`05 · Entity Relationship Diagram`

## Database tables and their relationships.

```mermaid
---
title: Team scoring-policy schema
---
erDiagram
  TEAM ||--o{ SCORING_POLICY : "issues"
  SCORING_POLICY ||--|{ WEIGHT_VERSION : "carries"
  SCORING_POLICY ||--o{ DECISION_ENTRY : "emits"
  TEAM {
    string teamId PK
    string name

    string teamId FK
    int version
  }
  WEIGHT_VERSION {
    int version PK
    bytes calibratedWeights
    timestamp expiresAt

<!-- _class: diagram -->

`06 · User Journey`

## Steps and the emotional state at each one.

```mermaid

---

<!-- _class: diagram -->

`08 · Pie Chart`

## Proportions of a whole.

```mermaid
pie showData
  title Decision-log events by source

<!-- _class: diagram -->

`09 · Quadrant Chart`

## Two-axis priority scatter.

```mermaid

`14 · Timeline`

## Events on a horizontal axis.

```mermaid
timeline
  title Decision Framework Roadmap
  section Phase 01 · Core
    Q1 : Scoring-policy model

  section Phase 02 · Scale
    Q3 : Per-team calibration

       : Intake pipeline
    Q4 : Historical migration
       : Automated recalibration
  section Phase 03 · Adoption
    Q1+1 : Org-wide enablement

`15 · ZenUML`

## A simpler sequence-diagram dialect.

ZenUML is a Mermaid diagram type that emits HTML+SVG with Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The Mermaid CLI can produce the markup, but it does not bundle the @zenuml/core stylesheet — so static SVG export renders the structure without the visual styling. ZenUML works in browser contexts where the Tailwind utilities resolve.

For static-PDF pipelines like this one, prefer the standard `sequenceDiagram` (slide 5) — same conceptual model, fully supported by the Mermaid CLI, themable through `themeVariables`.

```text
zenuml
  title Order
  Customer->Order.create() {
    Order->Inventory.check() {
      return available
    }
    return confirmed
  }
```

> ZenUML uses HTML/Tailwind rendering rather than pure SVG. Use sequenceDiagram for static export contexts.

`17 · XY Chart 🔥`

## Bar and line chart on a numeric axis.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Quarterly signals scored (thousands)"

## Tile layout for system blocks.

```mermaid
block-beta
