> Two-column term/definition table with auto-derived alphabetic range pill.

**Function** inventory · **Form** ledger · **Substance** structure

Use for jargon-heavy decks where the audience needs a reference page. The runtime auto-adds a range pill (e.g. 'A – G') to the heading.

## When to use

- **Jargon-heavy decks.** When the audience needs a reference page they can flip back to. Acronyms, domain terms, internal names — anything the speaker won't define inline.
- **Five to eight entries per slide.** The ledger is sized for a short page. For longer glossaries, split alphabetically across multiple slides — the runtime stamps each with its range pill.
- **Short definitions.** Each definition is one sentence — a working gloss, not an essay. Long definitions belong on their own subtopic slide where the term is the heading.

## When NOT to use

- **Multi-sentence definitions.** Each entry is one short line. If a definition needs context or examples, the term deserves its own slide — use subtopic with the term as the heading.
- **Mixed term lengths.** If some terms are single words and others are full phrases, the left column gets ragged. Trim long terms to their canonical short form.
- **Hand-written range pill.** The runtime derives the range pill (e.g. "A – G") from the entries. Authoring it into the heading double-stamps it.

## Universal modifiers

This layout accepts all universal variants (`dark`, `compact`, `loose`, `accent`, state markers, decoration backgrounds). See [docs/design-system.md §6.5](../../docs/design-system.md#65-universal-variants--three-tiers) for the catalog.

## Related components

- [`list-tabular`](../list-tabular/list-tabular.docs.md) — rows are key/value reference, not term/definition
- [`subtopic`](../subtopic/subtopic.docs.md) — one term needs a full slide of explanation
- [`actors`](../actors/actors.docs.md) — the left column is a named person, not a term
- [`principles`](../principles/principles.docs.md) — the entries are stated rules, not defined terms
