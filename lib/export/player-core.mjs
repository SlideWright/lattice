 *
 * The PURE, browser-safe assembly core of the self-contained `.html` player
 * (engineering/decisions/2026-07-08-studio-html-player-export.md, P1). Everything
 * here is DOM- and fs-free: it takes pre-rendered inputs plus *injected*
 * capabilities and returns the assembled player HTML. Two adapters supply the
 * environment-specific pieces (the sanitize-slide-html seam, reused):
 *
 *   - lib/export/html-player.js (Node)  — the CLI path: jsdom parse, DOMPurify
 *                                          sanitize, crypto sha256, fs image
 *                                          inlining, katex fs read, subset-font.
 *                                          Its output is BYTE-IDENTICAL to before
 *                                          this core was extracted (golden-pinned).
 *   - the Studio (browser, P2)           — real document/DOMParser, crypto.subtle,
 *                                          already-inline assets, fetched katex.
 *
 * The LOGIC lives once (HARD RULE #1): the player CSS/JS templates, minifyCss, the
 * component-aware prose projection, the CSP/envelope assembly. The prune (CSS +
 * font) stays ADAPTER-owned — the emulator prunes in Chromium, the Studio against
 * its live preview iframe — so it is deliberately NOT here.
 *
 * ESM (imported via dynamic `import()` from the CJS adapter, matching how the
 * adapter already loads sanitize-slide-html.mjs / present-transport.mjs).

/**
 * Serialize a deck's baked narration into one inert `<script>` per narrated slide.
 *
 * WHY NOT INSIDE THE MANIFEST ENVELOPE, which already has a `readAlong.slides[].audio` slot.
 * Two reasons, both about what a viewer actually pays:
 *
 *  1. DOUBLE ENCODING. `lattice-doc.js` base64s the WHOLE manifest — deliberately, so no
 *     deck content can terminate the script element. Audio nested inside it would therefore
 *     be base64'd twice: 1.33x on the clip, then 1.33x again on the manifest, for 1.78x
 *     over raw. On a 10 MB deck that is ~4.5 MB of pure encoding overhead, and the size of
 *     a shared deck is exactly the thing the author is being asked to consent to.
 *  2. EAGER PARSE. Audio in the envelope can only be reached by decoding and JSON-parsing
 *     the entire manifest — megabytes of main-thread work to play one sentence. Split per
 *     slide, the player parses only the slide it is about to speak, and a viewer who never
 *     presses Play parses nothing at all.
 *
 * The one-file contract is untouched: these blocks are inline `data:` URIs in the same
 * document, with no sidecar and no network origin.
 *
 * THE BREAKOUT GUARD. Whole-envelope base64 exists because a deck titled
 * `</script><script>…` would otherwise escape its own container (lattice-doc.js §Security).
 * This payload is not all base64 — the caption text is deck content — so it needs the same
 * property bought a different way: every `<` is emitted as the JSON escape `<`. The
 * HTML parser then never sees a `<` inside the block (so neither `</script` nor the `<!--`
 * that would flip it into script-data-escaped state can appear), while `JSON.parse` decodes
 * it back to the original character. HTML-entity escaping would be the WRONG tool here and
 * is deliberately not used: a `<script>` element's content is raw text, so `&amp;` would
 * survive into the parsed JSON verbatim and corrupt every caption containing an ampersand.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<{text?: string, estimateMs?: number, gapMs?: number, audio?: string|null}>>} slides
 *        per-slide cues, index-aligned to the deck's slides
 * @returns {string} the blocks, or '' when nothing carries audio

/**
 * Replace every `light-dark(LIGHT, DARK)` in a CSS string with one side of the pair.
 * `pick` 0 keeps LIGHT, 1 keeps DARK. Paren-aware (the top-level comma is found by

 * mistaken for the separator) and recursive (a nested light-dark inside the chosen
 * arm is resolved too). A single-argument `light-dark(x)` maps x to both sides.
 *
 * WHY this exists — the whole theming stack (themes/*.css) expresses every dual-mode
 * token as `--t: light-dark(L, D)`. That CSS function only shipped in Safari/WebKit
 * 17.5 (mid-2024); on an older in-app browser it is an invalid value, so EVERY token
 * goes unset and the deck loses its colors (falls back to white + wrong slide fills)
 * AND the dark/light toggle does nothing (nothing reads color-scheme except
 * light-dark). Resolving the pairs at export time into plain values + an explicit
 * dark override (see themeDualMode) makes the player theme correctly on every engine.
 *
 * String/url/comment SAFE: comments, quoted strings and `url(…)` are masked out (the
 * same one-pass tokenizer minifyCss uses) BEFORE the scan, so the literal text
 * `light-dark(` inside a `content:"…"` string, a `url("data:…")` data-URI, or a

/**
 * Split a stylesheet into a light-default base plus an explicit dark-override block,

 *   · base      — the CSS with every `light-dark(L, D)` collapsed to L (the light
 *                 value), so the deck renders correctly in light mode on ANY engine.
 *   · darkBlock — the dark values, as a small standalone rule set that applies when
 *                 the user picks dark (`:root[data-lp-scheme=dark]`) OR the OS prefers
 *                 dark and the user hasn't overridden to light
 *                 (`@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark) :root:not([data-lp-scheme=light])`).
 *
 * Every dual-mode token in Lattice's themes is a `--custom-prop: …light-dark(…)…`
 * declaration on `:root` (verified across all shipping themes), so consolidating the
 * dark values onto `:root[data-lp-scheme=dark]` is complete: custom properties on
 * :root inherit to the whole tree.
 *
 * SCOPE — the dark decls are hoisted onto a flat `:root[data-lp-scheme=dark]` without
 * their original selector context. That is correct precisely because every dual-mode
 * token today is a `:root` custom property. It is NOT selector-general: a (hypothetical,
 * none ship) `section.x{--t:light-dark(a,b)}` would hoist its dark `--t` onto :root,
 * where it can't beat the element-level base — so that one token would stay light in
 * dark mode. The light BASE is always correct regardless. A drift test
 * (test/unit/export/player-core-dualmode) would catch a future theme that breaks the
 * :root-only assumption; until then this stays :root-scoped by contract.
 *
 * Comments are stripped first, so a `light-dark(` (or an unbalanced paren) inside a
 * theme comment can't be collected as a phantom dark declaration.
 *
 * The darkBlock is emitted as its OWN small <style>, so the CSS prune (which only
 * ever targets the single LARGEST style block — the ~450KB lattice.css) never touches
 * it: its `:root[data-lp-scheme=dark]` selector matches nothing at prune time (the
 * attribute is set only on toggle) and would otherwise be dropped.

/* READ · SLIDES — the real slides as faithful miniatures. Each slide is a FIXED
   1280×720 canvas whose internal layout (a title slide centers, a content slide sits
   its text at the top) only renders correctly at that native size — resizing the box
   wrecks it. So keep the native size and SCALE the whole canvas with transform, NOT
   CSS zoom: iOS WebKit does not re-resolve container-type:size + cqi/cqh (the
   engine's whole typography/spacing scale) against a zoom-scaled container — cqi
   collapses to near-zero, rendering the type illegibly tiny (documented, previously
   REJECTED for this exact reason: engineering/gotchas.md "Preview slides collapse …
   CSS zoom", decision doc 2026-07-02-preview-scale-zoom.md). transform is immune —
   cqi resolves ONCE against the intrinsic 1280×720 box, and transform only scales the
   already-resolved paint. transform doesn't collapse the LAYOUT box the way zoom did,
   so each slide is wrapped in a .lp-frame sized to the scaled footprint
   (calc(1280px * var(--lp-fit))) — the flex column's gap then packs against that
   real size, same visual result as zoom gave, without breaking cqi. --lp-fit is set
   fluidly by the script to fill the column; the mobile default also serves the floor. */

   and its shadow (which spreads OUTWARD) was clipped away by this frame's
   overflow:hidden — so a white slide on the white page had no visible boundary at

/**
 * The narration transport, appended to the player script only when the deck ships baked
 * audio. Everything here is inside the main IIFE's scope, so it reads `slides`, `t`, `view`
 * and the two hooks the base script declares alongside it.
 *
 * THE SHAPE, and why it is this one:
 *
 *  · ONE `Audio` element, created on the play CLICK and reused for every cue. A fresh
 *    element per sentence is the obvious version and it is wrong on iOS: media playback is
 *    unlocked per ELEMENT by a user gesture, so cue 2 onward would be silently refused. The
 *    element is unlocked once and only its `src` changes after that.
 *  · CUES ARE READ LAZILY, one slide at a time. The audio blocks are inert `<script>` text
 *    until something parses them, so a viewer who never presses Play pays nothing, and a
 *    viewer who does pays one small parse per slide rather than one huge one up front.
 *  · A SILENT CUE STILL TAKES ITS TIME. A sentence the author never prepared holds its
 *    estimated read length instead of flashing past, so a partially-baked deck plays as a
 *    delivery with a few quiet lines rather than as a stutter.
 *  · THE BEAT IS SPENT ON THE SLIDE THAT ARRIVED. Advance, hold, then speak — the one
 *    ordering every practitioner agrees on, and the reason `pace:` exists (resolve-pace.mjs).
 *
 * @param {{slide: number, section: number}} beats the deck's resolved pace, in ms
