/**
 * Shared transformer registry — the central plugin list consumed by all
 * render paths (the engine — emulator + playground — and the runtime).
 *
 * Before this module existed, each renderer hand-rolled its own ordered
 * dispatch list and reimplemented the per-transform logic inline. Adding a
 * new transform required editing three files in lock-step; drift between
 * them was caught only by visual diff of the gallery PDFs. The registry
 * inverts the dependency: each transformer declares itself, and the
 * renderers iterate the registry. See engineering/decisions/2026-05-17-shared-
 * transformer-registry.md for the migration plan.
 *
 * Transformer module shape:
 *
 *   module.exports = {
 *     name: 'chart-family',                   // unique, stable, used for ordering + logs
 *     selector: 'section.progress, ...',      // CSS selector identifying applicable sections;
 *                                             // informational for HTML adapters, used as a fast
 *                                             // scope filter by DOM adapters
 *     applyToHtml(html, ctx?) { ... },        // string rewrite — full rendered HTML in, rewritten
 *                                             // HTML out (the engine render path + the
 *                                             // emulator via lib/engine). May append marker
 *                                             // classes to a <section> tag — e.g. chart-family
 *                                             // appends 'chart-frame'.
 *     applyToDom(root, ctx?) { ... },         // optional live-DOM walk (lattice-runtime bundle)
 *   };
 *
 * Order in TRANSFORMERS is significant. Adding a transformer that
 * depends on the output of an earlier one (e.g. compare-prose lifting
 * before split-compare structuring) goes AFTER its dependency.
 *
 * Idempotence rule: every transformer MUST be safe to run twice. The
 * engine path and the runtime path may both fire on the same DOM
 * during preview refreshes; an early-return guard
 * (checking for the layout's marker class) is the standard pattern.

  // Lifts the eyebrow + title into a .cell-masthead band on `form`-opted
  // sections. Operates on a disjoint section set (section.form) from every
  // other transformer, so its position is immaterial to correctness; grouped
  // with the structural transforms for readability.
  mastheadLift,
  // Adaptive image: stamps data-img-bucket / data-img-composition on the live
  // DOM by MEASURING the asset (browser only — applyToDom). The build/export
  // path stamps the same attributes from the file header (lattice-emulator.js).
  // Runs before image-scrim so a resolved `statement` has its composition set
  // when the scrim pass looks (though scrim keys off the class, which is
  // author-set for statement). applyToDom-only; no-op on the HTML string path.
  imageAdaptive,
  imageScrim,
  // Rewrites `logo-wall` marks from `<img>` to token-coloured `.logo-mark`
  // mask spans (palette fill, AA on both grounds). Disjoint section set
  // (section.logo-wall) from every other transformer, so position is immaterial
  // to correctness; grouped with the image transforms it's conceptually near.
  logoMarks,
  // Component-coupled structural transforms migrated out of parseSlide (the
  // engine + runtime paths rendered a flat code sequence before). Disjoint
  // section class (section.compare-code) from every other transformer, so
  // position is immaterial to correctness.
  compareCode,
  // Focus resolver — tags `.lat-focus` / `.lat-recede` on the ordinal target of
  // a `_focus:` directive. Runs AFTER the structural transforms above so the
  // collection it counts (list `<li>`, table `<tr>`) is in its final shape; the
  // CSS treatment is keyed on the tags it stamps. Disjoint from pill/below-note.
  focus,
  // Narrative build — stamps `data-build-step` on the steppable units of a
  // `_build:` directive (and `data-build-steps` on the section). Like focus, runs
  // AFTER the structural transforms so the collection is in its final shape; it
  // only TAGS (reveal is CSS gated on a consumer-set `data-build-at`). Disjoint
  // section set (section[data-build]) from focus and everything else.
  build,
  // Runs last: tags genuine trailing-`code` pills (code immediately before a
  // nested list) after all structural transforms have settled the li/code
  // shape. The CSS gates on `li > code.lat-pill`, so order vs the image
  // transformers is immaterial — last keeps the dependency story simple.
  pillTag,
  // Truly last: wraps a layout's trailing `<p>` (the hairline note) only
  // after every structural transform above has settled what the section's
  // final trailing element is. Whole-document walk (applyToHtml/applyToDom)
  // only. See lib/transformers/below-note.js.
