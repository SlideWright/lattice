/**
 * image-adaptive transformer — the RUNTIME (browser) half of the adaptive
 * `image` layout's composition resolver.
 *
 * The build/export path (lattice-emulator.js) reads each asset's intrinsic
 * dimensions from the file header (lib/core/image-dimensions.js, fs-based) and
 * stamps `data-img-bucket` + `data-img-composition` before the PDF is rendered —
 * deterministic, no image load. The browser has no fs, so this DOM walk does the
 * same job by MEASURING the asset (`new Image()` → naturalWidth/Height) and
 * stamping the same two attributes, so the docs-site preview / playground / live
 * marp-preview resolve the identical composition the export does.
 *
 * Single source of truth (HARD RULE #1): the bucketing + resolution table live
 * once in lib/core/image-aspect.js (pure, fs-free), shared by both paths. This
 * module only adapts that brain to a live DOM. An explicit author composition
 * class still wins (resolved synchronously, no measurement needed).
 *
 * applyToDom only — there is no applyToHtml: the engine string path can't
 * measure, and the emulator already stamps on its own fs-based pass.
 * See engineering/decisions/2026-06-19-adaptive-image.md.
