/**
 * Slice/deck equivalence — the PURE core, shared by the two surfaces that ask the same question.
 *
 * THE QUESTION. The preview shows one slide. Rendering that slide ALONE is far cheaper than
 * re-parsing the whole deck on every keystroke — but a slide can render things whose value comes
 * from OTHER slides (its page number, its section on the progress rail, its `cat-N` hue). So:
 * **does the slide rendered alone come out the same as that slide rendered inside the deck?**
 *
 * Two surfaces ask it, and neither should own the answer alone (HARD RULE #15, and the shape
 * lib/authoring/lint-core.js already set — pure, fs-free, so it bundles for the browser):
 *
 *   - `tools/slice-equivalence.mjs` — HEADLESS. Sweeps every committed deck and reports a rate
 *     against a committed baseline. No browser, so it can be automated and gated.
 *   - `docs/src/components/studio/PreviewFidelityOverlay.tsx` — AUTHOR-FACING. Answers it for the
 *     one slide in front of the author, on their real device, when something looks wrong.
 *
 * This module holds only what BOTH need: how to cut a deck into slides, how to rebuild the
 * directive context a slice lost, **what deck position may be handed to a slice render**, how to
 * compare two renders fairly, and how to name a difference. Nothing here touches `fs`, the network,
 * or the DOM.
 *
 * The position half arrived late and is the reason the sweep can fail at all: while
 * `positionIsTrustworthy` / `deckSectionFor` lived only in `docs/src`, the headless sweep rendered
 * every slice with no supplied position and would have passed with the shipped repair stubbed out.
 * See THE SUPPLIED DECK POSITION below.
 *
 * ONE IMPORT, and only one: `lib/core/slide-boundaries.mjs`, which is itself import-free. Every
 * other dependency is refused for the reason lib/authoring/lint-core.js refuses them — this has to
 * bundle for the browser. The engine's directive VOCABULARY lives in lib/engine/directives.js, which is CommonJS;
 * the docs bundler resolves `lib/**.mjs` as ESM but will not do named-export interop on a CJS file
 * there, so importing it would break the browser build outright. The vocabulary is DATA, not logic,
 * so `synthesizePrelude` takes it as an argument: the Node CLI hands it the real sets, and the
 * browser — which never synthesizes a prelude, only compares renders — never loads it at all.

// mode but to HAND IT the position the caller already holds (`page` on the render opts,
// lib/engine/index.js). These three functions decide what may be handed over.
//
// THEY LIVE HERE BECAUSE THE SWEEP HAS TO RUN THE SAME ONES. They were written in
// `docs/src/lib/single-slide-render.ts`, which the headless sweep cannot import (it is a browser
// module, and importing it would drag the whole docs bundle into a Node CLI). The result was a
// sweep that rendered all 1201 corpus slides with no supplied position at all: it reproduced the
// pre-#1272 behavior faithfully and would have passed with `positionIsTrustworthy` stubbed to
// `return false` — the originally reported bug, fully restored, at 0.0 points of movement. Moving
// the decision to the shared pure core is what makes the measurement able to fail (HARD RULE #1:
// one owner, both callers).
//
// All three are pure string functions over the deck source. `docs/src` imports them; nothing here

 * falls back to an honest 1-of-1); the slice route has no such backstop, so it has to earn the

 *
 * WHY A PROBE IS NOT ENOUGH, and how this was caught. An earlier cut gated on a `split: headings`

// ── ONE-ENTRY DERIVATION MEMO — the deck half of `deckSectionFor` ────────────
// Everything `deckSectionFor` computes is a pure function of the DECK except the final
// count-up-to-k, and the deck half is the expensive half: a whole-deck `md.block.parse` plus
// the code-blanking sweeps. The index half is a loop over a boolean array.
//
// It is asked for TWICE PER RENDER, on the same deck string, by two callers that do not know
// about each other — the preview's route gate (`DECK_DERIVED_FACTS` probes the divider count at
// index 0) and `supplyablePosition` (which needs the section for the shown slide).
//
// WHAT THE SECOND CALL COSTS WITHOUT THIS MEMO — stated carefully, because the first version of
// this comment got it wrong by ~4x. It said "1.354ms EACH … ~5.4ms of every keystroke", which is
// the cost of a COLD derivation and was measured before the boundary LRU landed in
// `lib/core/slide-boundaries.mjs`. With that LRU present the second derivation re-parses nothing
// — the string is already in the boundary cache — so its marginal cost is the code-blanking
// sweeps and the chunk walk, not a parse. Two changes in one branch must not each bank the same
// milliseconds. The honest figure is in Amendment 6 of
// engineering/decisions/2026-07-30-preview-deck-context-and-render-cost.md, measured with the
// two changes isolated from each other rather than stacked.
//
// ONE entry, replaced on any miss, so memory stays bounded at a single deck's chunk list rather
// than growing per deck — the same shape and the same reasoning as `deckMemo` in
// single-slide-render.ts. A KEYSTROKE MISSES BY CONSTRUCTION (the deck string changed) and that

	//     ---`a`        a paragraph to markdown-it; blank the inline span and it is `--- `, an hr

	//     `a`           a code-span-only line above `---`: setext underline raw, hr blanked

	// Two of those in a deck shift every later slot by two, so slide k reads slot k+2 — and the

	// lines this change rewrites.
	//
	// Chunking raw and blanking EACH CHUNK for the divider test asks the actual question — "does

	// THE AMBIGUITY BAIL SURVIVES, PER CHUNK — and an earlier cut of this change DELETED it, which
	// was wrong in a way worth recording because the deletion looked principled.
	//
	// The argument for deleting it: blanking per chunk removes the disagreement "at its source", so
	// there is nothing left to be unsure between. That is true of the case the bail was written for
	// (a `_class: divider` shown inside a code span) and FALSE in general, because it assumes
	// `blankCode` and the engine agree about what code IS. They do not:
	//
	//     - item
	//
	//           <!-- _class: divider -->
	//
	// Four spaces of indent is an indented code block at top level and CONTINUATION CONTENT inside
	// a list item, where the engine honors the directive. `blankCode` blanks it either way, so the
	// derivation reported no divider where the engine renders one — and with the bail gone, nothing
	// refused. `main` gets that deck RIGHT (raw and blanked counts disagreed, so it bailed to the
	// whole-deck render); the deletion made it wrong. A self-inflicted regression, caught by an
	// inversion pass against the engine as oracle, before it shipped.
	//
	// The lesson is the one the red-team finding above already taught, recurring one level up: the
	// old code held two INDEX SPACES together with an unwritten assumption, and the first fix held
	// `blankCode` and the ENGINE together with a different unwritten one. The bail is not a patch
	// for the code-span case — it is a DIFFERENTIAL, and a differential covers divergences nobody
	// enumerated. That is what cannot be recovered by listing cases, so it stays.
	//
	// IT COVERS ONE DIRECTION, NOT TWO, and an earlier draft of this comment claimed two. Measured:
	// it fires when `blankCode` REMOVES a directive the engine honors (over-blanking — the list
	// item above). It is structurally blind to the opposite failure, `blankCode` NOT recognizing
	// code that the engine does (under-blanking): then the raw and blanked readings agree, nothing
	// disagrees, and the derivation counts a divider the engine never renders. Confirmed shapes,
	// each verified against a real render — a fence inside a blockquote (`> ```md`, invisible to
	// the `^[ \t]*` anchor), an UNCLOSED fence (i.e. every author part-way through typing a code
	// sample), a ``` opened and `~~~` closed, and a double-backtick span. All of them are
	// PRE-EXISTING — `main` returns the same wrong section — so they are logged rather than fixed
	// here (HARD RULE #18), but the honest statement of this guard's reach belongs next to it.
	//
	// The real repair is not another regex: it is to read the divider flag off the ENGINE'S OWN
	// token stream (`fence` / `code_block` / `html_block`), which cannot disagree about what code
	// is — the same argument that retired the hand-written boundary scanner in favor of
	// `md.block.parse` (#1433). `blankCode` is the last hand-written approximation of the engine
	// left on this path. See Amendment 7.
	//
	// PER CHUNK rather than over the whole body, which is what keeps the index-space fix: the
	// comparison is now between two readings of the SAME chunk, so a disagreement anywhere makes
	// the whole derivation refuse rather than silently shifting later slots. It costs one extra
	// regex pass per chunk and no additional parse.
	//
	// The price, stated plainly: a deck that merely MENTIONS a divider inside code goes back to the
	// whole-deck render, as it does on `main`. An earlier cut of this change advertised keeping such
	// decks on the fast path. That was a real improvement and it is being given up on purpose,

 * `deckSectionFor` lived in `docs/src` — so it hid `pagination` and `rail` to keep differences it
 * had no way to repair out of the prototype's score. That made ~81 of its 91.9 points neutralizer,
 * and it meant breaking `positionIsTrustworthy` outright moved `equiv:check` by **0.0 points**: the
 * sweep was measuring the pre-#1272 engine, not the shipped preview.
 *
 * Now that the supply functions live HERE and the sweep calls them, both surfaces run the same
 * repair and compare the same way, so the asymmetry has nothing left to express. A page number or a
 * rail that differs is now a real finding on BOTH — the sweep's rate falls when a shipped repair
 * breaks, which is the property the split was preventing.
 *
 * Adding an entry back is therefore not a tuning knob: it re-blinds the sweep to a repair that
 * ships. `test/unit/diagnostics/slice-equivalence-core.test.js` pins the set for that reason.
 *
 * `whitespace` LEFT ON 2026-08-31, and it left on a measurement rather than an argument. It was
 * here on an attribution nobody had checked — that the sweep's own prelude injection shifts block
 * adjacency, so the body re-parses tight-vs-loose — and #1442 asks for that attribution to be
 * confirmed or replaced with the real number. It is neither true nor false so much as MOOT: across
 * the whole corpus the neutralizer hides exactly **0** divergences. Every slide it could flatter
 * differs in something else too, so removing it moves the rate by 0.0 points and costs nothing,
 * while keeping it leaves a blind spot for a whitespace-only regression that could appear later.
