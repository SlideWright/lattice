# run the full quality pipeline (lint, unit + integration tests, build, and
# PDF rasterization for visual review). Fresh containers clone the repo with
# NONE of the following, so every one of those commands fails until set up:
#
#   1. node_modules        → biome (lint), node --test, the build toolchain
#   2. poppler-utils        → pdfinfo / pdftoppm: PDF page counts (integration
#                            tests) AND rasterize-for-review.sh / pixel-check
#   3. CHROME_PATH         → marp-cli's headless Chromium (integration tests,
#                            any deck render). puppeteer caches the binary but
#                            it isn't on PATH.
#
# Web-only: local checkouts already have all three and we don't want to mutate
# a developer's machine on session start.

# 1. JS deps. npm install (not ci) is idempotent and benefits from
#    container-state caching after the first run; the lockfile pins versions.
#    Its `prepare` step also runs `lefthook install`, wiring the git hooks so
#    the pre-commit / pre-push gates are actually active in this session.
npm install --no-audit --no-fund

# 2. System deps for the PDF pipeline. A fresh container's apt index is often
#    stale, so refresh it once before installing — a stale index 404s on the
#    pinned .deb and silently leaves pdfinfo missing, which fails the integration
#    gate (and, under set -e, aborts the rest of this hook before CHROME_PATH is
#    exported). Only pay the update cost when something actually needs installing.

# 2a. poppler-utils → pdfinfo / pdftoppm (PDF page counts + rasterize-for-review).
#     Non-fatal: a transient apt outage must not abort the rest of setup; the
#     pre-push gate re-checks pdfinfo loudly anyway.
if ! command -v pdfinfo >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  apt-get install -y poppler-utils || sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils || true
fi

# 2b. ImageMagick → mogrify / identify, used by tools/rasterize-for-review.sh
#     for --crop / --region detail shots. Best-effort and non-fatal: the script
#     degrades to a poppler-only path (plain + --overview render, with PNG sizes
#     read via python3) when ImageMagick is absent, so a transient apt outage
#     only costs the crop feature, not visual review.

# 2c. Color emoji font. The owned render paths (lattice-engine, lattice-emulator)
#     emit raw unicode emoji as plain text (no twemoji <img>), so a color emoji
#     font must be present for them to render in color in headless Chromium. The
#     webfont @import in lattice.css is a portable bonus, but an installed font
#     is the reliable guarantee. Idempotent: skip if already present.

# 4. Docs-site deps. docs/ is a SEPARATE npm package (not a root workspace), so
#    the root install above never touches it — yet any docs/src/** preview or
#    screenshot needs it. Install best-effort so docs work is never blocked on a
#    manual `cd docs && npm install` (the single most-rediscovered friction).
#    Non-fatal and quiet: a transient failure must not abort the session.

# 5. Point every session at the centralized standard-practice digest. The hook's
#    stdout lands in the session's initial context, so this one line is what
#    turns "rediscover the sandbox each time" into "read it once, up front".
