status: proposed
summary: Retag structural divs to native AA-sensible elements (change the tag, keep the class, keep the styling — never wrap), governed by a promotion rubric that stops both under-tagging (Studio has no `<main>`) and over-tagging (landmark noise). Two surfaces — the app (website/Studio/Playground) and the decks (web preview + HTML export). The full Form/Cell/Tile → semantic HTML map (§4A) is adopted: the DECK is a self-contained composition → `<article class="lattice">` (with `<main>` as the shell/host landmark — where vs. what); a SLIDE stays `<section>` (a section of the deck-article; measurement + all CSS bind to it); the masthead/footer Cells become `<header>`/`<footer>`; the stage Cell stays `<div>`; liftable leaf cards become `<article>` (scoped, not every `<li>`). `<article>` plays its role at exactly the two liftable boundaries (deck + leaf card), never per slide. The container change is TWO edits on TWO render paths — a sanctioned `<main><article>` wrapper in the export shell (section-scoped CSS there) AND the engine/preview `div.lattice → article.lattice` retag with its lockstep `css.js` kernel edit — DECISION: do both. `<figure>` for charts folds into the SAME change (DECISION: one combined, export-signed PR). Headingless slides (quote/big-number) get a front-matter aria-label; presentational divs stay div (restraint). Owner call: best practice, don't settle. A THIRD adversarial round (§14) tested the worked example against the full "accessible to all, any device" goal: the semantic base is confirmed solid, but it surfaced a tracked GAP REGISTER above the HTML — the shipped PDF (untagged) + PPTX (image-only, no alt) artifacts (the doc's own "out of scope" premise was factually wrong and is corrected), fixed-canvas reflow (1.4.10), forced-colors, color-only tone (1.4.1), bare-`<title>` SVG naming (needs aria-labelledby cross-AT), a missing `<title>` (2.4.2), pagination context (1.3.1), and no axe gate. Each tagged foundation vs later baby step. Direction hardened by a red-team, an inversion pass, and an independent checker — which caught a shipped-regression aria-hidden defect, the two-path container reality, and that slides are mostly `<h2>` not `<h1>`; all folded in (§10). Guard rails get real gates, not prose. Forks resolved §13. REFRESH 2026-07-10 (§15) after ~119 commits: foundation intact + reinforced (Form-default shipped/audited; CVD textures now work in runtime), but a THIRD render surface appeared — the HTML Lattice player (now the primary shared artifact) — which re-poses the landmark problem and owns G1/G3/G6/G9 via its own AA+AXE docs; §5 Studio citations stale (activity-bar restructure, still no `<main>`); gap deltas G5 (partial, audio-only) / G6 (Read·Article reflows) / G9 (player TOC) / G11 (captions shipped); +menus→nav finding. §15 then HARDENED by a red-team/inversion/checker round (all three converged): facts confirmed exact, but three false-comfort verdicts corrected — the "player's AA+AXE checklist owns G1/G3/G6/G9" hand-off was laundering (those docs are `proposed`, the criterion is scoped to Read·Article/Slides only, no axe gate exists → gaps stay OURS); Read·Article reflow is LOSSY (visual layouts dead-end to non-reflowing views); the masthead/footer retag is no longer a pure tag-swap (carousel.js regex + nested-`<footer>` collision from Form-default); +a stale-citation banner (only §5/player citations re-verified). §16 adds the figure/figcaption implementation SPEC (verified vs main 2026-07-10): which nodes get `<figure>` (7 chart `*-figure` divs + word-cloud/diagram/functionplot SVGs) vs KEEP-native (gantt/kanban/progress/timeline-list — native markup, no SVG; journey is list-dominant); `<figcaption>` = the retagged `.chart-caption` with the title/subtitle/caption three-role split; the `image` carve-out gets an `alt:` field + `role="img"`/aria-label (not `<figure>`, its photo is a CSS background); qr/video/radar-mini already done.

# Semantic HTML for accessibility — retag, don't wrap

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Status:** design proposal (design-before-code; no CSS/transform written yet)
**Branch:** `claude/semantic-html-accessibility-qdht2a`
**Scope:** the app (docs site: marketing, Studio, Playground, Components) **and**
the decks (live web preview + HTML export). **Out of scope:** the export-to-Marp
bundle (`lib/core/marp-bundle.js` — the recipient's Marp owns that HTML shell).

> **Scope correction (2026-07-03, third adversarial round — §14).** An earlier
> draft also put "PDF/PPTX tag trees" out of scope with the parenthetical *"raster/
> print artifacts, not a DOM a screen reader walks."* **That premise is wrong** — a
> **tagged PDF's structure tree *is* exactly the DOM a screen reader walks.** The
> PDF and PPTX are the artifacts people actually ship, and today they are
> inaccessible (untagged PDF with no `lang`/`title`; image-only PPTX with no alt).
> They are back **in scope as tracked gaps** (§14). This decision note's
> *implementation* still starts with the HTML/app semantic base (the solid
> foundation), but the goal "accessible to all, on any accessible device" is not
> earned until the shipped artifacts are addressed — so they are named, not
> disowned.

> **This is the second draft.** The first was put through the three adversarial
> passes the brief asked for — a red team, an inversion analysis, and an
> independent checker. They confirmed the *direction* (retag-don't-wrap, a
> restraint rubric, slide-stays-`<section>`) and every WCAG/ARIA fact it leaned
> on, but overturned four load-bearing *mechanics*. §10 records exactly what
> changed and why; the body below is already corrected.

> **⚠ Citation banner (2026-07-10).** `main` advanced ~119 commits since this note
> merged. **§15 refreshed the §5 Studio citations and the player facts; the line
> numbers in §4 / §4A / §7 / §12 / §14 are NOT re-verified and are known-stale** —
> e.g. `masthead.transform.js:191`→`:258`, and the §12 file-map's
> `lattice-emulator.js:1450`/`:1461-1463` now point at unrelated code (a watermark
> comment / the overflow probe; the real shell is ~`:1545`). **Treat every line
> number below §15 as approximate — re-verify at implementation time.** The
> *structure* (which file, which element) is still correct; only the offsets moved.

> **▶ IMPLEMENTATION STARTED (2026-07-28) — read §17 first.** This note is no longer
> only a proposal: step 1 of the §13 sequence (the gates) has landed. **§17 is the
> measured baseline** — every §4/§4A claim re-verified against `main` by rendering
> the real gallery, not by grep. It supersedes the citation banner above for the
> facts it covers, and it CORRECTS two things the design got wrong about the
> codebase (the `aria-hidden` allowlist is unimplementable as specified; the chart
> `<figure>` spec is incomplete and partly moot). Start there.

## 1. The problem, in plain language

We already do well on the two accessibility axes people notice first: color is
palette-blind and CVD-safe, and text hits WCAG AA contrast. The axis we've barely
touched is the one a **screen-reader** user actually navigates by — **structure**.
A blind user doesn't scan the slide with their eyes; they jump between
**landmarks** ("skip to the main content"), **headings** ("what's on this slide"),
and **regions** ("the editor pane, the preview pane"). If the page is a soup of
`<div>`s, none of those jumps exist — the whole document is one undifferentiated
blob they must read top to bottom.

Two concrete holes, found by reading the code (not guessing):

- **The Studio — our flagship surface — has no `<main>` at all.** Its primary
  work region is a `<div class="group/split grid …">` (`StudioShell.tsx:1524,1542`).
  A screen reader offers the user no way to jump to the content; there is no "main"
  to skip to.
- **Every exported deck is a landmark desert.** The HTML export shell
  (`lattice-emulator.js:1449-1463`) has **no `lang`**, **no `<main>`**, **no skip
  link**, and no document title — just `<body>` with a flat pile of slide
  `<section>`s. A screen-reader user opening a shared deck link lands in an
  unlabeled, language-unset document.

The good news the recon turned up: **we are not starting from zero, and the fix is
mostly cheap.** The slide is *already* a `<section>`; the deck already emits
per-slide `<header>`/`<footer>`; 43 of 56 components already emit native markdown
(`<h1>/<h2>/<p>/<ul>/<table>`); the home page is already a clean
`<main>`/`<section>`/`<footer>` reference. And critically — **all *stylesheet*
selection is keyed on classes, not element types** (zero bare `div` selectors, zero
`> div` combinators across both `lib/**/*.css` and `docs/src/styles/`). So we can
change what most boxes *are* without changing how they *look*. (The two exceptions
where retag is *not* free — tag-qualified JS selectors and the engine's own packed
CSS — are the subject of §7 and §8, flagged by the checker and red team.)

---

## 2. What we want — and the one instruction that shapes everything

**One sentence:** *give every surface a landmark skeleton and sensible regions a
screen reader can navigate, by changing elements — not by adding wrapper `<div>`s.*

The "never wrap" instruction is not a style preference — it is load-bearing, for
three reasons the code forces on us:

1. **Wrapping breaks the height math.** HARD RULE #20: the layout measures via
   `getBoundingClientRect`/`scrollHeight` (the overflow probe, the Fit Spine).
   Every extra wrapper is another box the probe and the fit-scale must account
   for, and a wrapper that carries any margin corrupts the measurement outright. A
   *retag* adds zero boxes.
2. **Wrapping changes exported bytes.** A new DOM node shifts layout by a hair;
   PDF/PNG/PPTX are pixel-diffed against goldens. A block-for-block retag
   (`div`→`section`/`article`/`header`/`footer`/`nav`/`aside`/`main`) is the *same
   box model* — byte-neutral. (`<figure>` is the exception, quarantined in §7.)
3. **Wrapping fights the class-keyed CSS.** Since every stylesheet rule targets
   `.funnel-figure` / `.cell-stage` / `.pg-pane`, moving the class onto a
   *different tag* keeps every rule; inserting a *new* wrapper needs new CSS and
   risks descendant-combinator surprises.

So the whole design reduces to: **for each structural node, either promote its tag
to the native element that carries its role, or leave it alone — and add the small
set of genuinely-missing landmarks/attributes that no existing node can carry.**

**One honest exception up front (found by the red team, §10-R4):** the export
`<main>` *has* to be a wrapper, because the export shell throws the container away
(§4). That single wrap is sanctioned and safe (`<main>` has no UA margin; the
export's theme CSS is `section`-scoped, so a wrapper can't unstyle anything). It is
the *only* sanctioned wrap; everything else is a retag.

---

## 3. The one real design question: how far do we promote?

The naïve reading of "make it semantic" is "turn every `<div>` into a `<section>`."
That is a **trap**, and naming why is the spine of this design.

A screen reader turns landmarks and regions into a *navigation menu*. Ten genuine
regions is a useful menu. Forty `<section>`s — one for every visual box — is a menu
with forty items, most meaningless, which is **worse than none**: the user can no
longer find the three that matter. Over-tagging is an accessibility anti-pattern in
exactly the same way under-tagging is. (This is why WCAG 1.3.1 is about
*information and relationships* — real structure — not "use more elements.")

So "how semantic?" is not a dial you turn to maximum. It's a **judgment applied
per node**, and the design's job is to make that judgment a *rubric* instead of
taste. A `<div>` earns promotion only when a native element carries its **role**:

> **The promotion rubric.** Promote a `<div>` to element `E` only if the node's
> actual purpose matches `E`'s ARIA role, AND that role helps a user *navigate or
> understand*. Otherwise leave it a `<div>` — a plain grouping box is a correct,
> honest `<div>`.
>
> | Promote to | …when the node is | Role it gains | Nesting caveat |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | `<main>` | the one primary-content region of a document | `main` (skip target) | **exactly one per document** |
> | `<nav>` | a set of navigation links/controls (slide rail, primary nav) | `navigation` | keeps role when nested |
> | `<header>` / `<footer>` | the intro/meta strip of a document *or* section | `banner`/`contentinfo` at page top level; **generic inside a `section`/`article`/`main`/`aside`/`nav`** | degrades — this is a feature (§3 note) |
> | `<section>` | a thematic region a user would jump to, **that has an accessible name** | `region` — **only if named**; otherwise generic | must be named to count |
> | `<aside>` | complementary content beside the main flow (Inspector, Architect) | `complementary` | **keeps role even inside `<main>`** — so it must be a *sibling* of main, not a child (§10-R3) |
> | `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` | a self-contained graphic + its caption (a chart) | `figure` | UA margin — see §7 |
> | `<article>` | a self-contained, independently-meaningful unit — **the deck**, or a liftable leaf card (§4A) | `article` | keeps role; only at the two liftable boundaries |
> | **leave `<div>`** | a **presentational** box: a layout cell, a backdrop, a scrim, a positioning wrapper | none — correct as-is | — |

The rubric's most important row is the last one. `.cell-stage` (the body cell),
`.backdrop`, `.image-scrim`, `.lattice-bg`, the split-panel columns — these are
**presentational** boxes. They stay `<div>` (the genuinely-decorative ones also get
`aria-hidden` — but **never** a box that holds authored text; see §8-#4 and the
`.image-text` trap, §10-I1). Promoting the presentational boxes would manufacture
landmark noise for zero navigational gain. **Restraint is part of the design, not a
gap in it.**

Two nesting facts the rubric now states explicitly, because the first draft got the
second one wrong (§10-R3):

- **`<header>`/`<footer>` degrade to generic inside a sectioning element.** This is
  *why* the ~per-slide `<header>`/`<footer>` we already emit don't pollute the
  landmark map with 40 banners — each lives inside a slide `<section>`. A feature.
- **`<aside>` does NOT degrade.** A `<complementary>` stays a landmark wherever it
  sits, including inside `<main>`. So a `<main>` must never *contain* the Inspector
  or Architect asides — they belong beside it. This directly reshapes the Studio
  change (§5).

---

## 4. The mapping — decks (the engine), and the two-path reality

The single highest-value deck change is giving an exported deck a `<main>`, a
`lang`, and a skip link. The first draft treated "the deck container" as one node
to retag. The checker and red team proved there are **two independent render paths
with two different container realities** — so this is two edits, not one:

**Path A — the HTML/PDF/PNG/PPTX export (`lattice-emulator.js`).** The export does
**not** keep the `div.lattice` container. `splitTopLevelSections`
(`lattice-emulator.js:1133`) extracts bare `<section>` spans and **discards the
wrapper**; the shell injects those bare sections straight into `<body>`
(`:1463`), and re-applies slide geometry with a bare `section[data-lattice-slide]{…
!important}` rule (`:1457`). Its theme CSS is the raw, `section`-scoped
`lattice.css` (`:391`), *not* the engine's packed `div.lattice > section`. So:
- **Add a `<main id="deck" tabindex="-1">` wrapper around the injected slides**
  (`:1463`). This is the one **sanctioned wrap** (§2) — safe precisely because the
  theme CSS is `section`-scoped (a wrapper can't unstyle it) and `<main>` has no UA
  margin (byte-neutral). Changing `slides.js:229` would do **nothing** here.
- **Add `lang`** to `<html>` (`:1450`) — from the deck `lang` front-matter, else
  `en` (WCAG 3.1.1).
- **Add a skip link** as the first body child, `<a href="#deck">`, with the
  visually-hidden CSS *inlined* so it can never render visibly if a stylesheet is
  absent (§10-I7); the target `<main>` carries `tabindex="-1"` so focus actually
  moves (§10-I2 — the classic skip-link half-fix).

**Path B — the engine/preview render (`lib/engine`, used by the docs-site `srcdoc`
previews and the VS Code runtime).** Here the `div.lattice` container *is* present,
but the engine's own selector packer scopes **every** themed rule and the geometry
scaffold to `div.lattice > section`, deliberately tag-qualified to `div` for
(0,1,2) specificity that beats the preview-frame's `.lattice > section` sizing rule
(`lib/engine/css.js:104,243`, with the rationale in the comment at `:99-103`).
Retagging the container here therefore **cannot** be done in `slides.js` alone — it
requires editing `css.js` (the `scaffold()` rules `:104-153` and `packSelector`
`:243`) to emit the new tag at the same specificity, in lockstep across the shared
kernel (HARD RULE #1), proven by pixel-diff.

**Decision (Fork D, §13): do BOTH paths, and the container becomes `<article>`, not
`<main>`.** The refinement (§4A): the deck is a *self-contained composition* →
`<article class="lattice">`; the `<main>` **landmark** is supplied by the document
shell/host (the export shell wraps `<main><article class="lattice">…`; the app host
page already owns its `<main>`). `<main>` says *where the primary content is*;
`<article>` says *what it is* — orthogonal, and both correct. Path B carries the
lockstep `css.js` edit (`scaffold()` + `packSelector` → `article.lattice > section`
at the same (0,1,2) specificity — `article` is a type selector exactly like `div`,
so zero specificity cost), a pixel-diff, and a maker-checker pass. `<article>` has
no UA margin, so it stays byte-neutral in box terms; it is still one of the
export-bytes surfaces the single sign-off (Fork B) covers.

The per-node mapping (Path-independent). **Bold = a change; the rest is "confirmed
correct, leave it."** The structural model this table realizes is §4A.

| Node (today) | File | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| slide wrapper `<section>` | `lib/engine/slides.js:99` | **Keep `<section>`.** Already correct; measurement + hundreds of `section.<name>` rules + `div.lattice > section` packing depend on it. Non-negotiable (§8-#1). |
| deck container `div.lattice` | `slides.js:229` | **→ `<article class="lattice">`** (Path B) *with* the `css.js` lockstep edit (`article.lattice > section`) + pixel-diff. The deck is a self-contained composition (§4A). |
| export shell `<body>` slides | `lattice-emulator.js:1463` | **Wrap in `<main id="deck" tabindex="-1"><article class="lattice">…`** + `lang` + skip link. The sanctioned wrap — `<main>` is the landmark, `<article>` is the deck. |
| masthead Cell `.cell-masthead` | `masthead.transform.js:191` | **→ `<header class="cell-masthead">`.** It *is* the slide's header (title + eyebrow). Generic (not a banner landmark) because nested in the slide `<section>`. Class-keyed CSS + no UA margin → byte-neutral. |
| footer Cell `.cell-footer` | forms footer cell | **→ `<footer class="cell-footer">`.** The slide's footer (running text · progress rail · page number). Generic when nested; byte-neutral. |
| running `header:`/`footer:` directive | `slides.js:210,216` | **Reconcile to one per slide.** Today emitted as a second section-level `<header>`/`<footer>`; fold into the masthead/footer Cell as a chrome Tile so a slide has **exactly one** `<header>` and one `<footer>` (§8-#8). |
| headings from native components | (markdown) | **Keep authored levels.** Reality (§10-R1): mostly `<h2>`, one `<h1>` (`title`), a couple headingless (`quote`, `big-number`). Do **not** synthesize an `<h1>` per slide. |
| chart figure wrappers `.funnel-figure`, `.quadrant-figure`, `.radar-figure`, `.state-chart-figure`, `.functionplot`, … | 13 `*.transform.js`, `plugins.js:969` | **→ `<figure>` + `<figcaption>`** — a chart is the textbook `<figure>`. Its own late commit (§7): UA-margin, a JS-selector hazard, and export-byte cost. |
| liftable leaf cards (comparison / inventory cards that stand alone) | component transforms | **→ `<article>` — scoped.** A card that is independently meaningful is `article #2` (§4A). **Not** every `<li>`: over-articling floods the AT rotor exactly as over-sectioning does (restraint, §3). |
| `.cell-stage` (body cell) | `masthead-lift.js:63` | **Leave `<div>`.** Presentational layout cell; the probe keys on its *class*. Promoting adds a nameless region. |
| `.backdrop`, `.image-scrim`, `.lattice-bg` | plugins / scrim / bg-image | **Leave `<div>` + `aria-hidden="true"`.** Pure decoration; `.image-scrim`/`.backdrop` are already hidden today. |
| **`.image-text`** | `lib/core/bg-image.js:150` | **Leave `<div>`, and NEVER `aria-hidden`** — it holds the author's `<h2>`/`<p>` on every image slide (§10-I1, the caught regression). |
| split-panel columns `.panel-left/.panel-right` | `split-panels.js` | **Leave `<div>`.** Two columns of one comparison aren't two landmarks; the *content* inside carries its own semantics. (Alternative named-regions considered and rejected, §10-R-Fork-C.) |
| carousel card `.ct-card` | `carousel.js:329` | **Keep `<article>`.** Already correct — the first instance of `article #2`. |

Deliberately **not** doing at the deck level: `role=` on native elements (redundant
role is its own anti-pattern), and — the reframed decision — per-slide
`aria-label`s naming every slide as a region (that would flood the rotor with 40
named regions; §10-R1, Fork A).

---

## 4A. Form/Cell/Tile → semantic HTML — the structural map

The deck's whole layout model is already a tree — a **Frame** carves the slide into
**Cells** (masthead · stage · footer), each Cell holds **Tiles** (title, meta,
logo, footer, pagination, the content component); the canonical model is
`design/forms.md`. Semantic HTML is *also* a nesting vocabulary. The mapping rule is
one line:

> **Map each Form noun to the element whose ARIA role matches the noun's job** — not
> by tag taste. Where a noun's job is "just group some boxes," the honest element is
> a `<div>`. Where its job is a *role* (a header, a footer, a self-contained
> composition, a figure), use that element.

### Where `<article>` plays its role — the two liftable boundaries

`<article>` means one specific thing: **a self-contained composition you could lift
out and it still makes sense.** In our tree that property is true at exactly two
boundaries, and false everywhere between them:

- **`article #1` — the whole deck.** A deck is the textbook self-contained
  composition → **`<article class="lattice">`** (the container, Path B). This is the
  container change of Fork D — `<article>`, wrapped by the document's `<main>`.
- **`article #2` — a liftable leaf card.** A card that stands on its own (a carousel
  card — already `<article>`; a self-contained comparison/inventory card) →
  **`<article>`**, *scoped* to genuinely-independent cards, never every `<li>`.

**A slide is deliberately NOT an `<article>`.** It's a *section of* the deck-article
— part of the narrative, not independently syndicated — so it stays `<section>`, on
both semantic grounds (sections of an article) and mechanical grounds (measurement +
CSS bind to `section`). `<article>`-ness attaches only where the sub-tree is truly
liftable, which mirrors the Form model's own Composite recursion ("a component is
this grammar one level up," `forms.md:176`).

### The tree, current → target

### The table (the map, per noun)

| Form noun | Instance | Element | Why (role match) | Change? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(collection)* | the deck | **`<article class="lattice">`** | self-contained composition — **article #1** | div → article |
| **Frame** (root) | a slide | `<section data-lattice-slide>` | a section *of* the deck-article; the measurement anchor | keep |
| **Cell** — masthead | title band | **`<header class="cell-masthead">`** | the section's header (its heading area); generic when nested | div → header |
| **Cell** — stage | body box | `<div class="cell-stage">` | presentational layout cell — no role; the Tile inside carries semantics | keep |
| **Cell** — footer | bottom band | **`<footer class="cell-footer">`** | the section's footer; generic when nested | div → footer |
| **Tile** — content | the component | native / **`<figure>`** / **`<article>`** | per component; a *liftable card* is **article #2** | per-component |
| **Tile** — chrome: title | the heading | `<h1>`/`<h2>` | it *is* a heading | keep |
| **Tile** — chrome: pagination | page № | `<span class="lat-pagination">` | already content, not decoration | keep |
| **Tile** — chrome: meta/logo/status | masthead bay | `<div>` (in the `<header>`) | grouping of small chrome; no landmark role of its own | keep |
| **Tile** — surface: backdrop/atmosphere | decoration | `<div aria-hidden="true">` | leaves the accessibility tree | hide |
| **Tile** — review: annotation | overlay | `<aside>` (preview-only) | complementary; preview-only, never exported | keep |

Two invariants this map introduces, both gated (§8): **exactly one `<header>` and one
`<footer>` per slide** (so the running `header:`/`footer:` directive folds into the
Cell rather than emitting a competing second element), and **`<article>` only at the
two liftable boundaries** (deck + scoped leaf cards) so the AT rotor isn't flooded.

Every promotion here is *byte-neutral* in the box model (`article`/`header`/`footer`
are all `display:block`, no UA margin — only `<figure>` isn't, §7) and *visually
free* (class-keyed CSS: `<div class="cell-masthead">` → `<header class="cell-masthead">`
keeps every rule). The only mechanical cost is the container's `css.js` lockstep edit
(Path B) — one shared-kernel change, pixel-diffed.

---

## 5. The mapping — the app (docs site)

The home page is already the reference (one `<main>`, real `<section>`s, `<header>`,
`<footer>`, `<nav aria-label="Primary">`). The work is bringing the app surfaces up
to it. **Bold = change.**

| Surface | Change |
|---|---|
| **Studio** (`StudioShell.tsx`) | **Add a `<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">` scoped to the editor+preview subtree — NOT the whole split grid** (which contains the Architect/Inspector `<aside>`s; an `<aside>` keeps its landmark role inside `<main>`, so the asides must stay siblings of main, §10-R3). **Cover all four view branches** — mobile (`:1498`), focus (`:1521`), desktop (`:1537`), **and Fabricate (`:1494`)**, which the first draft missed (§10-R-M1); wrap once above the branch if cleaner. **Name each region** (`<section>`/`<aside>`/`<nav>`) via `aria-labelledby` pointing at a **dedicated `<span id>`**, not a label *container* (which would concatenate junk, §10-I2); Studio has **no** `.pg-pane-label` (that's Playground-only), so audit each region for a real label node first, else use `aria-label`. Regions that can collapse to a rail must be named by an always-present label or `aria-label` (§10-I8). |
| **Playground** (`PlaygroundApp.tsx`) | Already has `<main>` + `<section>` panes and `.pg-pane-label` anchors (`:584,603`). **Name the panes** (`aria-labelledby` → a text `<span id>` inside the label, not the label div). Add a **skip link** + `tabindex="-1"` on `<main>`. Optional **`<footer>`** for parity. |
| **All standalone pages** | Add a **skip-to-content link** as the first *tabbable* element, targeting each page's `<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">`. None exist today. The page skeleton is duplicated per page, so this is applied per surface — *unless* we first extract a shared skeleton (a follow-up). |
| **SiteHeader** (`SiteHeader.astro`) | **No change** — already `<header>` + `<nav aria-label="Primary">`. The one shared top-nav; leave it. |
| Preview iframe | **No landmark change** — separate `srcdoc` document (isolated tree); its *content* is Path B of §4 (in scope). Host references it accessibly already (`<iframe title="Rendered slides preview">`). |
| Split panes | **No change — and record it so a future retag doesn't regress it:** the resize handle is already keyboard-operable (`ui/split.tsx`: `role="separator"`, `tabindex`, `aria-orientation/valuenow/valuemin/valuemax`, `onKeyDown`) (§10-R-L3). |

One element-coupling watch-item the recon flagged: `.db-edit-diff > div`
(`drawing-board.css:1023`) is the **only** element-combinator selector in the whole
docs-site style tree — and it's on the **frozen** Drawing Board, off the path of
every surface we're touching. Noted, not touched (HARD RULE #18: off-path, logged
not pulled in).

Form inputs are **already labeled** (CodeMirror `aria-label="Deck source"`; the
Playground pickers use `<label htmlFor>`/`aria-label`), so labeling is not a gap
here (§10-R credit).

## 6. The genuine forks (RESOLVED — see §13)

Four real decisions the rubric doesn't settle on its own; each is now **decided**
(§13). The options are kept below for the record — the chosen option is marked
**← chosen**.

**Fork A — headingless slides and the slide-as-region question.** The first draft
claimed "40 `<h1>`s"; the truth (measured) is ~1 `<h1>` (`title`) + mostly `<h2>` +
a couple **headingless** slide types (`quote`, `big-number`). So the real question
isn't de-duping h1s — it's what to do about slides with *no* heading and whether a
slide should be a *named region* at all.
- **(A1, recommended — ← chosen) Keep authored heading levels; leave slide
  `<section>`s generic (unnamed).** No 40-region rotor flood; the heading list is a
  clean slide index. For the headingless types, derive a lightweight `aria-label` on
  that slide's `<section>` from front-matter/first text so it isn't literally
  nameless-in-the-heading-rotor — a narrow, opt-in fix, not a blanket per-slide
  label.
- (A2) Name *every* slide `<section>` (aria-label per slide). Rejected: floods the
  region rotor with 40 entries — the exact over-tagging §3 forbids.

**Fork B — when do we do the `<figure>` conversion for charts?** A real semantic
win, but the one part that (a) needs a `margin:0` UA reset, (b) risks matching
existing `:is(…figure…)` CSS *and* the fluid-view owl rule, (c) will break the
`div.functionplot` JS selectors unless they're updated (§7), and (d) **changes
exported bytes → your export sign-off** (QUALITY BAR).
- **(B1, recommended) Two phases.** Ship the byte-neutral landmark/retag work first
  (export `<main>`/lang/skip link, Studio main + region names, Playground names +
  skip link) — no export sign-off. Then `<figure>` as its own branch with a
  rendered dark+light demo deck **and a real NVDA/VoiceOver pass** for your sign-off.
- **(B2) ← chosen** — One change, one sign-off round covering everything. The whole
  feature becomes an export-bytes change gated on one inspection; simpler to reason
  about as a single reviewable diff, at the cost of no early byte-neutral landing.

**Fork C — confirm the restraint stance.** The rubric deliberately **leaves
`.cell-stage`, the split columns, backdrops, and scrims as `<div>`.** I'm confident
this is right (they're presentational; promoting them manufactures landmark noise).
The one place it's a genuine judgment call is the split-panel columns — a
comparison's two columns *could* be `aria-label`d regions ("left/right panel") if
you read it as a true two-region compare. I recommend **not** (the content inside
already carries semantics), but flag it as the one arguable call. **← chosen:
restraint confirmed** (split columns stay `<div>`).

**Fork D — the deck container scope (from §4).** (D1) do the export `<main>` now and
**defer** the engine/preview container retag. **(D2) ← chosen, refined** — do both
now, and the container is **`<article class="lattice">`** (with `<main>` as the
shell/host landmark): the export wrapper *and* the engine-path `div.lattice →
article.lattice` kernel change, pixel-diffed and maker-checked. Carries the Cell →
`<header>`/`<footer>` promotions too (§4A).

---

## 7. The `<figure>` conversion — real work, its own commit, the sign-off surface

`<figure>`/`<figcaption>` for the ~13 chart transforms is the highest-semantic-value
change *and* the highest-risk. It rides in the same branch (Fork B — one combined
change) but as its **own late commit**, because it is the export-bytes surface the
sign-off exists for. Its four hazards, each a checklist item:

- **UA margin.** Browsers default `figure` to `margin-block: 1em; margin-inline:
  40px` (**not** `40px 0` — the first draft swapped the axes; §10-R-M3). The
  dominant effect is a **40px horizontal inset** that shrinks a centered chart's
  width (and shifts the overflow-probe's width math), not a vertical shift. A bare
  `margin:0` reset fully neutralizes it (no UA padding/border on `figure`), and a
  bare reset is explicitly allowed by HARD RULE #20.
- **JS-selector hazard.** The runtime and export select `div.functionplot[data-fp-config]`
  **by tag** (`lib/runtime/index.js:1309`, `lattice-emulator.js:1406`). Promoting
  `.functionplot` to `<figure>` without changing those selectors **silently stops
  function plots rendering**. Each `<figure>` conversion must either change the JS
  to a class-only selector first, or stay off the do-not-retag list.
- **CSS leak.** ~56 existing selectors already say `:is(svg, figure, .functionplot)`;
  a newly-`<figure>`'d node starts matching them, and `base.fluid-view.css:58`'s
  `> :not(:is(header, footer, figure, …))` owl rule flips the node's flex-grow
  behavior — a real layout leak, not cosmetic. Each conversion is verified against
  the per-component gallery (light + dark page counts) + `pixel-check.js`.
- **Export bytes + SR verbosity.** Margin/layout deltas change PDF/PNG/PPTX rasters
  → **human sign-off on a rendered demo deck in both modes**. And a chart-heavy
  deck with ~13 figure types floods NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver with "figure… figure end"
  announcements; the sign-off must include a **real screen-reader pass** (HARD RULE
  #23 — real surface, not spec reasoning), and a rule that a `<figcaption>` must
  **not duplicate** a heading/alt already inside the figure (double-announcement).

The `<figcaption>` also *upgrades* the caption from a styled `<div>` to the caption
role — a genuine win, provided it isn't a duplicate.

---

## 8. Guard rails — invariants **with gates**, not prose

Inversion asks: *what would guarantee we make accessibility (or the render) worse?*
Each answer is a rule — and, per HARD RULE #18 ("an invariant with no gate is a
future regression"), the load-bearing ones get an actual **gate or test**, using the
allowlist/ratchet machinery `tools/check-ownership.js` already has (§10-I6). The
first draft stated these as prose only; that was itself a #18 violation.

1. **The slide wrapper stays `<section>`, always.** The overflow probe selects
   `section[data-lattice-slide]`; every component CSS is rooted at `section.<name>`;
   the packer emits `<container>.lattice > section`. Retagging the slide silently
   kills overflow detection and unstyles every component. **Gate:** a unit test on
   `render()` asserting the slide token is `section`.
2. **The deck is one `<article>`; the `<main>` landmark is the shell's, and there is
   exactly one per document.** The container renders `<article class="lattice">`; the
   single `<main>` comes from the document shell/host. **Gate/design:** make the
   container tag a *parameter* (`article` for the deck) and emit the `<main>` only at
   the export-shell / host call site, so a second `<main>` is *physically
   unemittable* rather than guarded by a comment. A tripwire you can't trip beats a
   note. (The `css.js` packer must move `div.lattice` → `article.lattice` in lockstep,
   §4/§4A.)
3. **No nameless landmarks.** A promoted `<section>`/`<aside>`/`<nav>` ships with an
   `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` **in the same edit**. **Gate:** a jsdom test over
   rendered app surfaces asserting every non-slide `<section>`/`<aside>`/`<nav>` has
   an accessible name — *and* a **landmark-count budget** (ratcheted like the other
   `check-ownership` budgets) so the N+1th region is a conscious decision, closing
   the "promote only if named is gameable" gap (§10-I1-noise).
4. **`aria-hidden` only decoration — never content.** **Gate:** a
   `checkAriaHiddenAllowlist` in `check-ownership.js` failing on any `aria-hidden`
   class outside `SANCTIONED_ARIA_HIDDEN = {.backdrop, .image-scrim, .lattice-bg}`.
   `.image-text` (and any prose wrapper) is barred — this is the caught regression
   (§10-I1). Also: don't add redundant native roles (`role="main"` on `<main>`).
5. **No nested bare `<section>` with a colliding class.** A raw `<section class="x">`
   inside slide content matches `section.x` component rules. Promotions inside a
   slide use non-colliding classes or non-`section` elements (`figure`/`article`).
6. **Byte-neutrality is verified per surface, not assumed.** Phase-1 block-box
   retags are pixel-diffed against goldens **on the surfaces goldens cover (emulator
   PDF/PNG)**; the runtime/VS-Code preview and the Studio `html-to-image` "Share
   image" path are **not** golden-covered, so any change touching them is either
   driven on the real surface or marked **UNVERIFIED** (HARD RULE #23) (§10-I7).
7. **Skip links actually move focus.** Target carries `tabindex="-1"`; the link is
   the **first tabbable** element on its surface; the visually-hidden CSS is inlined
   so it can't render visibly if a stylesheet is missing.
8. **One `<header>` and one `<footer>` per slide; `<article>` only at the two
   liftable boundaries.** The masthead Cell is the `<header>`, the footer Cell is the
   `<footer>`, and the running `header:`/`footer:` directive folds in as a Tile — not
   a competing second element (§4A). `<article>` appears only as the deck container
   and as scoped liftable leaf cards, never per slide and never per `<li>`. **Gate:**
   a jsdom test over rendered gallery HTML asserting ≤1 `<header>` and ≤1 `<footer>`
   per slide `<section>`, and that no slide `<section>` is itself an `<article>`.

## 9. The cost, priced

| Change | You gain | You spend |
|---|---|---|
| export shell `<main><article class="lattice">` wrap + `lang` + skip link (Path A) | every exported deck gets a skip target, a language, a named main, and a deck-as-article | ~a dozen lines in the emulator shell; a golden re-diff (block-box, should be zero-delta) |
| deck container `div.lattice → <article>` (Path B) + masthead/footer Cell → `<header>`/`<footer>` | the full Form/Cell/Tile semantic map (§4A): deck=article, slide=section, header/footer cells | the container's shared-kernel `css.js` lockstep edit + pixel-diff + maker-checker; the Cell swaps are class-keyed + byte-neutral |
| liftable leaf cards → `<article>` (scoped) | self-contained cards announce as articles | a per-component judgment (only genuinely-liftable cards); no `<li>` blanket |
| Studio `<main>` (editor+preview scope) + region names, all 4 views | the flagship app surface becomes navigable; regions named | JSX tag swaps + `aria-labelledby` spans; a region-label audit; visually free |
| Playground/pages skip links + region names | keyboard users bypass chrome; regions named | per-surface edits (skeleton isn't shared yet) |
| chart `<div>` → `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` (**same combined change**) | charts + captions gain the figure/caption roles | UA-margin resets, JS-selector fix, CSS-leak audit, **export sign-off + real SR pass** |
| the new a11y **gates** | the invariants can't silently rot (the #18 lesson) | ~5 small gate/test additions, one-time |
| **leaving presentational divs alone** | a *usable* landmark menu (no noise) | the temptation to "finish" by tagging everything — deliberately not spent |

The design's value isn't "more semantic elements." It's a **navigable structure
that's honest** — real landmarks where they help, plain `<div>`s where they don't,
gates so it stays that way, and every export-byte delta (container retag + figures)
surfaced for your sign-off rather than slipped in.

---

## 10. The adversarial passes (what changed and why)

Three independent passes ran against the first draft — a red team (attack the
design), an inversion analysis (enumerate how we'd ship a regression while believing
we improved things), and an independent checker (verify every technical/WCAG/code
claim). They **confirmed the direction and every WCAG/ARIA fact** the design leans
on (header/footer→generic when nested; `<main>` at most one per document;
`<section>`→`region` only when named; the HTML5 outline algorithm is dead so nesting
never auto-demotes headings; the SC-level mappings 3.1.1/2.4.1/1.3.1/2.4.6/4.1.2 are
right). They overturned four **mechanics**, each folded into the body above:

- **I1 (inversion, CRITICAL — a shipped regression in the draft):** §12 of the draft
  listed `.image-text` as an `aria-hidden` target, but `.image-text` holds the
  authored `<h2>`/`<p>` on every image slide (`bg-image.js:150`) — hiding it would
  blank out image-slide text for screen readers. **Struck**; `.image-text` is now
  explicitly barred, and an `aria-hidden` **allowlist gate** enforces it (§8-#4).
- **Checker (CRITICAL) + R4 (red team, HIGH) — the two-path container reality:** the
  draft's "retag `div.lattice → <main>` is a free class-keyed swap" was false on
  *both* paths, in opposite ways. The engine/preview CSS is tag-qualified to
  `div.lattice > section` (so the swap needs a lockstep `css.js` kernel edit); the
  export **discards** the container and injects bare sections (so the swap does
  nothing there — the `<main>` must be a wrapper). **Rewritten as two edits on two
  paths (§4); both are in scope (Fork D chosen "do both", §13).**
- **R1 (red team, HIGH) — "40 `<h1>`s" is false:** measured, the deck is ~1 `<h1>` +
  mostly `<h2>` + a couple headingless slides. Fork A was solving a non-problem;
  **reframed** around the real gap — headingless slides and whether a slide is a
  named region (§6-A, §4).
- **R3 (red team, HIGH) — Studio `<main>` over-scoped:** the split grid contains the
  Architect/Inspector `<aside>`s, and `<aside>` keeps its landmark role inside
  `<main>`. **Rescoped** to the editor+preview subtree with the asides as siblings;
  the rubric now states the aside-doesn't-degrade asymmetry (§3, §5).

Plus the medium/low findings folded in: skip-link targets need `tabindex="-1"` and
must be the first tabbable element (§8-#7); `aria-labelledby` must point at a text
`<span id>`, not a label container (§5); the Studio **Fabricate** view branch was
missed (§5); the `<figure>` UA margin is `1em 40px` and the `div.functionplot` JS
selector + fluid-view owl rule are real phase-2 hazards (§7); byte-neutrality is
only golden-verified on the emulator surface (§8-#6); the split-pane resize handle
is already keyboard-accessible and must not regress (§5); form inputs are already
labeled (§5).

---

## 11. Rejected alternatives

- **Wrap content in new semantic wrappers.** Breaks the measurement math (#20),
  changes export bytes, needs new CSS. Retag beats wrap *because* our stylesheet CSS
  is class-keyed. (The single sanctioned exception is the export `<main>`, forced by
  the shell discarding the container — §4.)
- **Maximal semanticization (every `<div>` → `<section>`).** Manufactures landmark
  noise; a 40-region menu is worse than none. Rejected for the promotion rubric (§3).
- **Change the slide element to `<article>`.** Kills the overflow probe and every
  `section.<name>` / `div.lattice > section` rule. A slide is a *section of a
  presentation*, not a syndicated article. Rejected (§8-#1).
- **ARIA-first (sprinkle `role=`/`aria-*` onto existing divs).** "No ARIA is better
  than bad ARIA" — use the real element; reserve ARIA for names and the few genuine
  gaps. Rejected as the primary tool.
- **Do the whole thing (incl. `<figure>` and Path B) in one pass.** Couples the
  byte-neutral fast win to two sign-off/kernel slow paths. Rejected for phasing
  (§6-B, §6-D).
- **Name every slide as a region / synthesize a per-slide `<h1>` (Fork A2).** Floods
  the rotor; built on the mismeasured "40 h1s." Rejected (§10-R1).

---

## 12. File map (for whoever implements)

One branch, many commits, one PR (HARD RULE #17); the commits are the §13 sequence
(gates → app/export landmarks → Cell retags → engine kernel → figures → sign-off
deck). The whole diff is export-bytes-changing, so it merges only after your sign-off.

**Commits 1–2 — gates + byte-neutral landmarks/retags:**
- Export shell `<main id="deck"><article class="lattice">` wrap + `lang` + skip link
  + inlined visually-hidden CSS + `tabindex="-1"`: `lattice-emulator.js:1450`
  (`lang`), `:1461-1463` (skip link + `<main>`/`<article>` wrap around
  `${slidesWithMeta2}`).
- Masthead/footer Cell → `<header>`/`<footer>` (class-keyed, byte-neutral):
  `lib/forms/cell/masthead/masthead.transform.js:191` (`.cell-masthead` element), the
  footer-cell emitter; reconcile the running `header:`/`footer:` directive
  (`slides.js:210,216`) so it folds into the Cell — **one `<header>`/`<footer>` per
  slide** (§8-#8).
- Decorative `aria-hidden` (allowlisted only): `plugins.js` (`.backdrop`),
  `lib/core/bg-image.js` (`.lattice-bg` — **not** `.image-text`); `.image-scrim`
  already hidden. Add `checkAriaHiddenAllowlist` + `SANCTIONED_ARIA_HIDDEN` to
  `tools/check-ownership.js`.
- Studio `<main>` (editor+preview scope, all 4 view branches) + region names:
  `docs/src/components/studio/StudioShell.tsx` (`:1494` Fabricate, `:1498` mobile,
  `:1521` focus, `:1537` desktop; `aria-labelledby` → new `<span id>`s).
- Playground names + skip link: `docs/src/components/playground/PlaygroundApp.tsx`,
  `docs/src/pages/playground.astro`.
- Skip links on standalone pages: `docs/src/pages/index.astro`,
  `docs/src/layouts/ComponentsLayout.astro`.
- Gates/tests: slide-stays-`<section>` render test; container-tag parameter (deck =
  `<article>`, one `<main>` per document); one-`<header>`/`<footer>`-per-slide +
  no-slide-is-`<article>` test; nameless-landmark + landmark-count-budget jsdom test.
- `CHANGELOG.md` `## Unreleased` (HARD RULE #10); the landmark contract + promotion
  rubric + the §4A Form/Cell/Tile map into a new canonical
  `engineering/accessibility.md`.

**Commit 3 — Path B engine/preview container retag (pixel-diff + maker-checker):**
- `lib/engine/slides.js:229` (`div.lattice → <article class="lattice">`) **in lockstep
  with** `lib/engine/css.js` (`scaffold()` `:104-153`, `packSelector` `:243`
  → `article.lattice > section`), preserving (0,1,2) specificity over the
  preview-frame `.lattice > section` rule; pixel-diff proof; maker-checker (shared
  kernel, HARD RULE #1).
- Liftable leaf cards → `<article>` (scoped): the comparison/inventory card transforms
  where a card is independently meaningful; carousel already done.

**Commit 4 — `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` for charts:**
- The ~13 `lib/components/**/*.transform.js` figure wrappers + `plugins.js:969`
  (`.functionplot`); co-located `margin:0` resets; the `div.functionplot` JS
  selectors (`runtime/index.js:1309`, `lattice-emulator.js:1406`) changed to
  class-only first; CSS-leak audit against `:is(…figure…)` + `base.fluid-view.css:58`.

**Commit 5 — the sign-off artifact:** a rendered dark+light demo deck
(`examples/<slug>.md` + committed `.pdf`, HARD RULE #9) + a real NVDA/VoiceOver pass;
this is what you inspect before merge (export sign-off gate).

**Docs to update in the same change(s):** `engineering/gotchas.md` (the `<figure>`
UA-margin + `div.functionplot` traps; the one-`<main>`-per-document tripwire; the
two-path container reality), and the new `engineering/accessibility.md` as the
canonical landmark/rubric reference.

## 13. Decisions (resolved at sign-off, 2026-07-03)

**Overarching call (2026-07-03): employ the full best-practice mapping, don't settle
for the minimal landmark set because the fuller change is harder.** So the complete
Form/Cell/Tile → semantic HTML map (§4A) is adopted as canon — with the restraint it
builds in (the stage stays `<div>`, decoration stays hidden, `<article>` only at the
two liftable boundaries, not every `<li>`), because over-tagging is itself a
best-practice failure. The four forks (§6):

1. **Fork D — deck container: do BOTH paths, container → `<article>` (refined).** The
   export shell wraps `<main id="deck"><article class="lattice">`; the engine/preview
   container `div.lattice → <article class="lattice">` with the lockstep `css.js` edit
   (`scaffold()` + `packSelector` → `article.lattice > section`, preserving (0,1,2)
   specificity over the preview-frame `.lattice > section` rule), a pixel-diff, and a
   maker-checker pass (shared kernel, HARD RULE #1). *Refinement over the first
   resolution (`<main>` on the container): `<main>` is the shell/host **landmark**
   (where), `<article>` is the deck **composition** (what) — orthogonal and both
   correct, same specificity cost, byte-neutral.* Alongside it, the **Cell → element**
   promotions land: masthead Cell → `<header>`, footer Cell → `<footer>`, with the
   running directive folded to one-per-slide (§4A, §8-#8). *Rationale: "we don't
   settle" — the full map is the best-practice structure; the kernel change is bounded
   and gated.*
2. **Fork B — `<figure>`: one combined change.** No two-phase split. The chart
   `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` conversion ships in the same branch as the landmark
   work, under a single export sign-off round covering the whole diff. This makes
   the entire feature an **export-bytes change → your inspection is a hard gate
   before merge** (QUALITY BAR): a rendered demo deck in dark + light, plus a real
   screen-reader pass (§7), signed off by you.
3. **Fork A — headingless slides: generic sections + label the headingless.**
   Authored heading levels kept; slide `<section>`s stay generic; `quote` /
   `big-number` (and other heading-free types) get a front-matter-derived
   `aria-label` so they aren't invisible in the heading rotor.
4. **Fork C — restraint confirmed.** Presentational boxes stay `<div>`, split-panel
   columns included; promote only nodes that carry a navigational role.

Everything else — the retag-not-wrap principle, the promotion rubric, the
slide-stays-`<section>` invariant, the §8 gates, and the §10 corrections — was
settled in the second draft. What remains is **one branch, many commits, one PR**
(HARD RULE #17), culminating in the export sign-off gate. The precise
front-matter-derived `aria-label` wording for headingless slides and the exact
region-label copy for the Studio panes are left to the implementation branch (not
blockers to this proposal).

**Sequencing within the one branch** (so each commit banks a working slice and the
sign-off sees the whole picture): (1) the a11y **gates** first (they fail-safe the
rest); (2) the byte-neutral app + export landmarks; (3) the engine-path container
kernel change (pixel-diff); (4) the `<figure>` conversion (`div.functionplot` JS
selectors fixed first); (5) render the sign-off demo deck + SR pass. Steps 3–4 are
the export-bytes surface; the PR does not merge until they're signed off.

## 14. Accessibility gap register — "accessible to all, any device" (beyond the HTML)

A third adversarial round (red team · inversion · independent checker) tested the
worked example (§4A) against the **full** goal: *accessible to all, on any
accessible device and software.* It confirmed the **foundation is solid** — the
things below are verified correct: skip link + focusable `<main>`; `.image-text`
never hidden; `aria-hidden` only on decoration; `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` and a
nested `<svg>` compute **separate** names (one-name-per-node holds); multiple `<h2>`
under one `<h1>` is valid; `prefers-reduced-motion` is already respected for build
reveals (vestibular is the best-covered population); and the §8 gates are
well-designed. **The semantic base is the right thing to build on.**

**Credit where the CVD baseline is already strong (correction to an early
overstatement).** Lattice ships **5 colorblind themes** (`a11y-base`,
`-deuteranopia`, `-protanopia`, `-tritanopia`, `-achromatopsia`) AND
`lib/core/accessibility-textures.js` — a shared `<defs>` of **12 distinct SVG
`<pattern>` geometries** that texture **chart marks** (`chart-family.js:319`,
`fill:url(#latt-a11y-tex-N)`) **and their legend swatches** (`svg-legend.js:218`).
So categorical **chart series already carry a non-color channel *in the SVG***, and
the legend maps by texture — genuine WCAG 1.4.1 redundant encoding reaching the
charts, not just CSS. Two scoping facts: it is **opt-in via theme** (inert unless an
`a11y-*` theme wires the fills — a *normal*-theme deck's chart fills are still
color-only, and a viewer of a static export can't switch it on), and it covers chart
**series** — **not** the tone rail (G4) and **not** blind-user *data* equivalence
(G5, a different population). Bonus: the pattern **geometry survives forced-colors**
(hues forced, shapes remain distinct), so a11y-themed charts are more robust in
Windows HCM than G7 implies.

But the base is not the whole goal. The round surfaced gaps in **layers above the
HTML** — the shipped artifacts, low-vision reflow, forced-colors, and data
equivalence — plus **two factual corrections to this doc**. These are tracked here
as **baby steps to build on the foundation**, not blockers to the foundation
itself. Each is tagged **[FOUNDATION]** (get right now / it rots) or **[LATER]** (a
real gap, safe to sequence after the base lands).

### Two corrections to this doc (the round caught these in *our* design)

- **The scope premise was wrong (fixed, §Scope).** "PDF/PPTX aren't a DOM a screen
  reader walks" is false — a tagged PDF's structure tree *is*. PDF/PPTX are back in
  scope as gaps (G1).
- **`<svg role="img">` with bare child `<title>`/`<desc>` is NOT reliably announced
  cross-AT** (VoiceOver/Safari, older JAWS drop it). The durable pattern is
  `role="img"` **+ `aria-labelledby="{title-id}"` + `aria-describedby="{desc-id}"`**.
  The §4A worked example and §7 must use the id-referenced form, not bare
  `<title>`/`<desc>`. **[FOUNDATION]** — get the figure pattern right the first time.

### The register

| # | Gap | Who it fails | SC | Tag | The fix (baby step) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** | **PPTX is image-per-slide with no `altText`** (`pptx-export.js:57-63`); **PDF is untagged** with no `lang`/`title`/structure (`lattice-emulator.js:1791`, `:1449`) | every AT user of the *shipped* files | 1.1.1, 1.4.5, 2.4.2, 3.1.1 | **✅ CHEAP WINS SHIPPED 2026-07-04; full tagging still LATER** | ~~Now: add `lang` + `<title>` to the shell (flows into Chrome's auto-tag `/Lang` + title); pass `altText` to PPTX `addImage`.~~ **DONE:** PPTX `altText` = the `describe:` description (descriptions PR); PDF shell now emits `<html lang>` + `<title>` → Chrome print carries `/Lang` + `/Title` (verified). **Still LATER:** a real tagged-PDF pipeline for per-image `/Alt` structure OR route AT users to the HTML export. **Don't claim full PDF/PPTX tagging until then.** |
| **G2** | **No `<title>` on the export shell** (`lattice-emulator.js:1450`) — even the target snippet omitted it | all AT + tabbed browsing | **2.4.2** (A) | **✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-04** | ~~Emit `<title>` from the deck title.~~ **DONE:** the shell emits `<title>` (front-matter `title:` → first heading → filename) + `<html lang>`; `buildSrcdoc` declares `lang` for the Studio Print + preview frames. |
| **G3** | **Pagination is a bare "2"** — no context | SR/braille orientation | **1.3.1** (not 4.1.2 — checker correction) | **[FOUNDATION]** | `aria-label="Slide 2 of 7"` (or visually-hidden "Slide "/" of 7"), sourced from deck length. Cheapest high-value win. |
| **G4** | **Tone rail is color-only** (`box-shadow`, `base.variants.css:95`); **status is a CSS `::after`** (`status.css`) — both AT-invisible. *(Note: this is the NON-chart residue — chart series ARE textured, see the CVD-credit above; tone/status are not.)* | colorblind (sighted!) + SR | **1.4.1** (A), 1.3.1 | **[FOUNDATION]** | Status → real DOM text (already in §4A). Tone → a **VISIBLE** non-color cue (icon/label/shape) — mirror the existing `accessibility-textures` idea onto the rail, don't leave it hue-only; `sr-only` helps SR (1.3.1) but does **NOT** satisfy 1.4.1 for sighted colorblind users (checker A7 correction to Finding #2). |
| **G5** | **SVG charts name the *type*, not the *data*** — `<desc>` is a conclusion, not equivalence | blind users on chart/diagram slides | **1.1.1** (A) | **[LATER]** | Emit a visually-hidden data table (quadrant: vendor×reach×depth) / ordered step list (diagram: nodes+edges) from the same structured source that draws the SVG (single source → can't drift). |
| **G6** | **Fixed-px canvas can't reflow**; the fluid viewer is opt-in, HTML-only, and clips dense slides (`base.fluid-view.css`) | low-vision zoom/reflow (the largest population) | **1.4.10, 1.4.4, 1.4.12** (AA) | **[LATER — architectural]** | Finish the fluid viewer as the reflow answer (default-on narrow, pair with re-pagination so dense slides reflow not clip); the *shared* PDF/PPTX can't reflow → route reflow users to HTML and mark PDF/PPTX non-conformant for 1.4.10. |
| **G7** | **Zero forced-colors handling** (grep: no `forced-colors`/`prefers-contrast` in `lib/**`); shadow/hue signals vanish in Windows HCM. *(Charts partly survive: the SVG texture geometry (§CVD-credit) stays distinct when hues are forced — but only under an `a11y-*` theme, and tone/status/scrim don't.)* | Windows High Contrast / photosensitivity | 1.4.1, 1.4.11 | **[LATER]** | A `@media (forced-colors: active)` pass: re-express shadow state as `outline`/`border` (kept in HCM), opaque backing behind `.image-text`, and — cheap win — make chart textures active in forced-colors regardless of theme. CVD-safe *palettes* don't cover this (though the texture engine partly does for charts). |
| **G8** | **Running head/foot repeated in the AT tree on every slide** | braille / swipe-nav verbosity | 1.3.1 (quality) | **[LATER]** | If it's print chrome (confidentiality notice), `aria-hidden` it (state it once at document level); else expose once, not per-slide. |
| **G9** | **One skip link, no TOC/inter-slide nav** for a long deck; generic slide sections | keyboard/switch/SR navigation | 2.4.1 (quality), 2.4.6 | **[LATER]** | Emit a `<nav aria-label="Slides">` table of contents. Note the Fork-A tension (checker A8): naming every slide `<section>` for the rotor is the *right* call at deck-scale even though §3 warns against it at slide-scale — revisit the threshold. |
| **G10** | **No automated a11y gate** (no axe/pa11y/jest-axe anywhere); §8 gates are structural-only | regression over time | governance | **[FOUNDATION]** | Add `axe-core` on rendered gallery HTML in CI (cheap; closes the "new component ships div-soup" hole) alongside the §8 structural gates. Later: a periodic tagged-PDF/PPTX-alt check. |
| **G11** | **Whole populations unaddressed:** video/audio has **no captions/transcript** requirement (`imagery/video/`); no cognitive/plain-language affordance | deaf/HoH; cognitive | 1.2.x | **[LATER]** | Name them in scope; require captions/transcripts the moment any audio ships (present narration, video, read-aloud); defer cognitive with a tracked owner. |

### Verification honesty (the round's #5 finding)

The planned "real NVDA/VoiceOver pass" (§7) must be widened, and its limits stated:
it has to cover the **shipped artifacts** (NVDA/JAWS on the **PDF**; PowerPoint on
the **PPTX**), not just the HTML; and a matrix of {NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver-mac,
VoiceOver-iOS, TalkBack} × {HTML, PDF} × {prose, chart, image deck}. **This sandbox
cannot run iOS/macOS VoiceOver, JAWS, braille, or switch/voice control** — so those
surfaces are **UNVERIFIED** by definition here (HARD RULE #23) and must be marked so,
never converted to "tested." The SVG-naming reliability (correction above) is exactly
one of the things only a real VoiceOver pass can confirm.

**Bottom line:** the semantic HTML/app base is the correct foundation and is largely
right (the confirmed-fine list proves it). "Accessible to all, any device" is a
**layered** goal — G1 (artifacts) and G6 (reflow) are the two that most make the
headline false today, and both are sequenced **on top of** the foundation, not
instead of it. Baby steps, in order: the **[FOUNDATION]** rows land with the base
(G2, G3, G4-status, G10, the SVG-id fix, G1's cheap `lang`/`title`/`altText`); the
**[LATER]** rows are the tracked backlog.

---

## 15. Refresh — the codebase moved (~119 commits); what changes for us (2026-07-10)

This note was written as #736 and merged; `main` then advanced ~119 commits before
we revisited. Several landed on the exact surfaces this doc maps. **The foundation
is intact and, in two ways, reinforced.** But there is a **new render surface**, the
**§5 citations are stale**, and **five gap-register rows move**. This section is
authoritative where it contradicts the body above; the body's *principles* stand.

### 15.1 A THIRD render surface — the HTML Lattice player (now the primary HTML deliverable)

§4 modeled two paths (export shell + engine/preview). There is now a **third**: the
**HTML Lattice player** (`lib/export/player-core.mjs`, `assemblePlayer()`), the
"Download as webpage" self-contained `.html` (#834/#831). It is **built from** the
emulator HTML but **extracts the bare `section[data-lattice-slide]` nodes and
re-wraps them in its own `lp-*` chrome**. It is the **primary self-contained *HTML***
deliverable — but *not* the primary share overall: `ShareSheet.tsx:105-121` lists six
targets and "Webpage (.html)" is fifth, behind Present-link, PDF, and PPTX (PDF is
the repo's canonical boardroom artifact). *(Corrected — the first draft overstated it
as "the artifact users now actually share"; §15 red-team H1.)* Its shell
(`player-core.mjs:358-395`) already emits `<html lang>` + `<title>`
(G2 partly met there) but:

- **No `<main>`** — slides sit in `<div id="lp-app"> → <div id="lp-stage">`.
- **A nameless `<nav id="lp-toc">`** (violates §8-#3) and a **second `<article
  id="lp-article">`** that is the *prose projection*, **not** §4A's `article #1`
  (deck). §4A's deck-level `<main>`/`<article class="lattice">` do **not** survive
  the player (it discards the container) — so the player **re-poses the landmark
  problem one level out**.
- **Its own chrome debt:** icon-only buttons (`☰ ⛶ ☾`) named only by `title` (weak);
  `#lp-count` renders bare "1 / 7" (reintroduces **G3**), not a live "Slide 1 of 7";
  no `prefers-reduced-motion` in `playerCss()` (small motion surface).

**Implication for §4A:** the map now has **three surfaces**, and the player-core
shell — not `lattice-emulator.js` — is where the deck-level `<main>` + labeled
toolbar/nav edits land. §4A's *slide-internal* retags (masthead→`<header>`,
chart→`<figure>`) still belong in the engine and **flow through** the player's
Present/Read·Slides views unchanged.

**Coordinate — but these gaps are NOT on the player's checklist yet, and they stay
OURS until they are.** *(Corrected after the §15 adversarial round — the first draft
of this paragraph was the round's CRITICAL finding: it laundered four open gaps into
"someone else's checklist" against a plan that doesn't contain them.)* The verified
reality:
- Only `2026-07-07-html-lattice-player.md:196-198,490-491` commits any a11y — and
  it is **`status: proposed`**, **pending P4** ("must be tested, not asserted"), and
  scoped to **Read·Article / Read·Slides** (heading semantics, TOC focus,
  reduced-motion). `2026-07-08-studio-html-player-export.md` has **zero** a11y
  content. So the plural "both docs already commit" was false.
- That checklist does **not** mention the player *shell*'s `<main>`, the
  `<nav id="lp-toc">` label, the icon-button labels, G3 pagination, or reflow — all
  of which live on the Present/global shell surface it never covers.
- **No axe gate exists in the repo** (§14 G10), and even an AXE run would **not**
  catch two of these: AXE's `button-name` accepts a `title` as an accessible name
  (the `☰ ⛶ ☾` buttons "pass"), and bare "1 / 7" (G3) isn't an AXE-detectable defect.

**So G1 / G3 / G6 / G9 remain OPEN and OWNED BY US** — not delegated. The correct
move is to get these player-shell items **added** to the 07-07 P4 exit list (and add
a11y to 07-08), and to land the axe gate (G10); until *both* an axe gate and the
player-shell fixes ship, these are our tracked gaps, not "handled." "Feed the
acceptance criteria" is right; "the player owns these now" was wrong.

### 15.2 §5 Studio citations are stale (activity-bar restructure, #826)

The Studio chrome was consolidated onto a **left activity bar**
(`2026-07-06-studio-activity-bar.md`). The **core finding holds — Studio still has
ZERO `<main>`** — but every line number in §5 moved. Current structure
(`StudioShell.tsx`):

- Split grid: `:2017` (mobile/focus) / `:2039` (desktop) — was `:1524/:1542`.
- Asides: `:2060` / `:2067` / `:2084` — was `:1560/:1574/:1583`.
- Headers: `:1761` / `:1773` — was `:1323/:1335`.
- **New:** `<nav aria-label="Studio panels">` (`:1740`, the activity bar) and the
  existing `<nav aria-label="Slide navigator">` (`:1685`). The panel launcher being a
  **named `<nav>`** is the "menus→nav" pattern done right (see §15.5).

§5's *action* is unchanged (add `<main>` scoped to the editor+preview subtree, keep
the asides as siblings) — only the citations refresh.

### 15.3 Two reinforcements — with two new wrinkles the retag must handle

- **Form-default is shipped + audited** (`2026-07-09-form-migration-audit.md`
  `status: shipped`, #848/#866 + ~8 "survives cell-stage wrap" fixes). The §4A cell
  tree (`.cell-masthead`/`.cell-stage`/`.cell-footer`) is now the **canonical
  default**. The masthead→`<header>` half genuinely firms up (`.cell-masthead` is a
  real div; retag is byte-neutral). **But two wrinkles the §15 round surfaced mean
  the retag is no longer a pure "swap the tag" for the footer or the masthead:**
  - **Masthead retag now needs a lockstep parser edit.** String-literal consumers of
    the exact opening tag landed: `lib/core/carousel.js:55,187` do
    `inner.replace(/<div class="cell-masthead">…/…)`. Retagging to
    `<header class="cell-masthead">` makes those regexes **silently miss** →
    carousel/compare-prose misparse (a silent render break, not a compile error). The
    retag must also switch those matchers to class-based (like the `css.js` lockstep
    §4 already accounted for) — an expansion of blast radius "reinforced" hid.
  - **Footer retag hits a nested-`<footer>` collision.** Form-default now **absorbs
    the running `footer:` directive (`slides.js:212`, a section-level `<footer>`)
    into `.cell-footer`** (`masthead-lift.js:95-108`). So a naive `.cell-footer` →
    `<footer>` yields `<footer class="cell-footer"><footer>…</footer></footer>` —
    two nested footers, which the §8-#8 "≤1 `<footer>` per slide" gate is built to
    fail. The retag must **demote the inner running `<footer>` to a `<span>`/`<div>`**
    when promoting the Cell.
  - (Line-number citations throughout §4/§4A shifted with these fixes — see the
    top-of-body citation banner.)
- **CVD textures now work in the live runtime** (#859 — the a11y-* pattern defs
  "never worked in live preview" until this fix; `lib/runtime/index.js:40-46`). The
  §14 CVD credit is now real **cross-path**, not CLI-only.

### 15.4 Gap-register deltas

| Gap | Move | Now |
|---|---|---|
| **G1** (shipped-artifact accessibility) | **concrete vehicle** | The webpage **player** is the primary, self-contained, sanitized, `lang`+`title` HTML deliverable — the real answer to "route AT users to the HTML export." Still unfinished (its §15.1 debt), but no longer hypothetical. Reframe G1's HTML answer around the player + its AA/AXE docs. |
| **G5** (chart data equivalence) | **partial, audio-only** | #862 narrates **computed context** (journey % share, radar/quadrant **axis scale**, state-chart start/end) so an eyes-free listener gets the scale — but via **Present-mode read-aloud**, sourced through `slideToSpeech`, **not** a DOM text alternative in the exported `<figure>`. G5 stays open for the **static-export screen-reader** path (still no data table); the narration is a substrate a future figure-description could reuse. |
| **G6** (reflow) | **partially addressed — and lossy for visual decks** | Read·Article reflows **prose-bearing** slides (`#lp-article{max-width:740px}`). But it is **not** a full reflow answer: chart/media components with a single SVG are re-hosted and merely **shrink** (not reflow); pure CSS-layout components (gantt/kanban/roadmap, no single SVG) fall to a **placeholder** — *"best seen in the Present or Read·Slides view"* (`prose-projection.mjs:153`) — which **dead-ends the reflow user at the fixed-canvas views that fail 1.4.10.** So 1.4.10 is met for prose, **open for visual-dense decks.** Present/Read·Slides stay `transform:scale` (fail 1.4.10). |
| **G9** (TOC / inter-slide nav) | **largely met in the player** | The player ships `<nav id="lp-toc">` with scroll-spy — but it is **nameless** (needs `aria-label="Slides"`) and **hidden below 820px** (mobile gap). |
| **G11** (audio/video captions) | **read-aloud limb met** | Narrated audio ships with a synchronized word-highlight **and** a first-class Share-sheet `.vtt` export (#845) + `--captions` CLI (#844). The `.vtt` is a **byte-neutral sidecar** (no export-sign-off impact). Still **[LATER]**: captions on the real `imagery/video/` media element, and cognitive/plain-language. |
| **(new) Player chrome debt** | **added — OURS, not delegated** | Not in the original register: player needs a `<main>` around `#lp-stage`, `aria-label` on `<nav id="lp-toc">` + the icon buttons, "Slide N of M" for `#lp-count`, and a `prefers-reduced-motion` guard. These are **NOT on the player's P4 checklist today** (which is scoped to Read·Article/Slides heading/TOC/reduced-motion) and an AXE run wouldn't catch the icon buttons (title = a name to AXE) or G3 — so they must be **added** to that checklist, and stay ours until they + an axe gate ship (§15.1). |

### 15.5 Capture: navigation menus → `<nav>`, but action/command menus are NOT

A finding not in the merged doc. **A *navigation* menu is `<nav>`; an *action/command*
menu (a dropdown of commands, a ⌘K palette) is the menu-button pattern
(`<button aria-haspopup aria-expanded>` → `role="menu"`/`menuitem`), NOT a `<nav>`
landmark.** Wrapping a command menu in `<nav>` (or landmarking every dropdown) is
over-tagging. Two concrete instances:

- **Right:** the Studio activity bar is `<nav aria-label="Studio panels">` (§15.2) —
  it *is* navigation between panels. Correct.
- **Wrong (a tracked finding):** `SiteHeader.astro:65` puts **navigation links**
  (`toolsNav` — the Tools dropdown, real page `href`s like `/playground/`,
  `/studio/`, a subset of `primaryNav`) inside `role="menu"` / `role="menuitem"`.
  That's the *inverse* error — the *action-menu* role for what are *page links*.
  `role="menu"` implies an app command menu with arrow-key semantics, not a link
  list. The Tools disclosure should be a `<nav>` (or a plain disclosure + list), not
  `role="menu"`. Add to the app-landmark (§5) work.

### 15.6 Verdict (corrected after the §15 adversarial round)

The design's **facts and principles hold** — retag-not-wrap, the promotion rubric,
the slide-stays-`<section>` invariant, and the Form/Cell/Tile map are all
code-confirmed, and the player-shell inventory (§15.1) + Studio citations (§15.2) are
exact. What changed is **surface count** (now three: export shell · engine/preview ·
**player**). But the round caught this refresh's *framing* trying to give false
comfort three ways — all now corrected above:

1. **The gaps are OURS, not delegated.** G1/G3/G6/G9 are **not** on the player's
   checklist (only Read·Article/Slides heading/TOC/reduced-motion is, in one
   `proposed` doc), no axe gate exists, and AXE wouldn't catch the icon buttons or
   G3. They stay open + owned by us until they're *added* to the player's P4 list and
   an axe gate ships. "Feed the criteria," never "the player owns these."
2. **Read·Article reflow is lossy** (prose reflows; charts shrink; visual layouts
   dead-end to a non-reflowing view) — G6 is met for prose, open for visual decks.
3. **The retag's blast radius grew** — Form-default's cell-stage/footer absorption
   means the masthead/footer retag now needs lockstep parser edits
   (`carousel.js:55,187`) and a nested-`<footer>` demotion, not a pure tag-swap.

So: **no foundation rework, but not a free "coordination + citation refresh" either.**
The honest next steps are (a) land the slide-internal retags in the engine (they flow
through the player's Present/Read·Slides), (b) get the player-shell items *added* to
the 07-07 P4 list + land the G10 axe gate, (c) handle the carousel/footer lockstep
edits, and (d) treat every line number below §15 as approximate (citation banner,
top of body).

## 16. `<figure>` / `<figcaption>` scope — the implementation spec

§4A/§7 decide *that* charts become `<figure>`; this section pins down *which nodes*,
*what the caption is*, and *what is carved out* — the detail an implementer needs and
the earlier drafts left in chat. **The per-component split below is verified against
`main` on 2026-07-10; re-verify at build time (§15 citation banner).**

### The two rules

- **`<figure>`** wraps a **self-contained graphic** — a single SVG chart, a rendered
  diagram, a QR code, a video poster. Not a list, not a table, not prose.
- **`<figcaption>`** is a **retag of the caption the author already wrote** — the
  trailing paragraph the chart kernel peels into `<p class="chart-caption">`. It is
  **optional** (present only when authored) and is **never synthesized** from the
  title.

### What gets `<figure>` (and what deliberately does NOT)

| Component(s) | Emits today | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| `funnel` · `map` · `piechart` · `quadrant` · `radar` · `roadmap` · `state-chart` | `<div class="*-figure">` + `<svg>` | **→ `<figure>`** (all 7 wrappers are `<div>` today). **`radar` caveat:** retag only the outer `.radar-figure`; radar *already* emits `<figure class="radar-mini">` + `<figcaption>` for its mini swatches (`radar.transform.js:617-619`) — leave those. |
| `word-cloud` | single `<svg>` | **→ `<figure>`.** |
| `diagram` | Mermaid `<svg>` | **→ `<figure>`.** Ensure the SVG carries a `<title>` (mermaid may emit none — §14 finding). |
| function plot | `<div class="functionplot">` + `<svg>` | **→ `<figure>`** — but **fix the `div.functionplot` JS selectors first** (§7), or plots silently stop rendering. |
| **`gantt` · `kanban` · `progress` · `timeline-list`** | **native markup** (no transform — CSS-styled lists/tables/grids) | **KEEP native semantics.** These are not single graphics; `timeline-list` is literally a list (`<ol>`). Wrapping them in `<figure>` would be wrong. |
| **`journey`** | `<svg>` **+** heavy list markup (list-dominant) | **Judgment call at build** — likely keep the list as the primary structure with the SVG as an inline graphic; do not blanket-figure it. |
| `image` | CSS `background-image` on `.lattice-bg` (**no `<img>`**) | **Carved out** — see below. No `<figure>`. |
| tables · lists · prose · `big-number` · `quote` | native `<table>`/`<ul>`/`<h_>`/`<p>` | **Already semantic** — a data table is not a figure. |

**Already done (do not redo):** `qr` emits `<figure class="qr-figure">`; `video` emits
`<figcaption>`; the HTML player's prose projection emits `.lp-figure` for re-hosted
media (a consistency reference, `prose-projection.mjs`).

### What gets `<figcaption>`

- **`.chart-caption`** — the only caption class the engine emits (the author's trailing
  paragraph). → `<figcaption>`. A `diagram-caption`, if authored, likewise.
- **Three distinct text roles, kept apart** (this is the anti-duplication contract, §7):

  | Role | Element today | Lives | Job | Stays / becomes |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | **title** | `<h2>` | lifted to the masthead `<header>` — *outside* the figure | names the **slide** | stays `<h2>` |
  | **subtitle** | `<p class="chart-subtitle">` | in the figure header | secondary framing | stays `<p>` |
  | **caption** | `<p class="chart-caption">` | tail of the figure | describes the **graphic** | **→ `<figcaption>`** |
  | **the graphic** | `<svg>` | inside the figure | names the **image** | keep `<title>`/`<desc>`, referenced by `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby` (§14) |

  **One accessible name per node, no `aria-label` piled on top**, and the `<figcaption>`
  must not repeat the `<h2>` or the SVG `<title>` (double-announcement, §7).

### The `image` carve-out — no figure, an `alt:` mechanism instead

`image` is not figured because its photo is a **CSS background** (`.lattice-bg`), not an
`<img>`. Its authored text is the `body` field ("Optional caption") — a **visible
caption, not a `<figcaption>`**. Its accessibility is a *different* mechanism (net-new,
not yet built):

- **Add an `alt:` field** (distinct from `body`, which is the visible so-what caption).
- **Decorative photo** (the text is the message — `statement`, most `spotlight`) →
  `.lattice-bg aria-hidden="true"` (current, correct).
- **Informative photo** (`gallery` — diagrams/screenshots "where every pixel matters";
  product shots) → `.lattice-bg role="img" aria-label="{alt}"` (a CSS-background div
  *can* be announced this way — no restructuring to `<img>` needed). **`alt` should be
  required for `gallery`.**

### Byte cost + gate

`<figure>` is the **one** retag that is not byte-neutral (UA `margin: 1em 40px`) — every
conversion ships a co-located `margin:0` reset and goes through **export sign-off**
(§7). The `role="img"`/`aria-label` image work and the SVG-`<title>` naming are
byte-neutral attribute additions. None of this closes **G5** (a caption + a `<title>`
name the chart; they don't give a blind user its *data* — the data-table alternative
stays tracked).

---

## 17. Implementation baseline — measured against `main`, 2026-07-28

§15 refreshed this note by reading code. **This section refreshed it by rendering
the deck** — `lib/engine.render()` over the full component gallery (117 slides),
read as a DOM in jsdom. Where the two disagree, the render wins: it already caught
one grep-derived claim of mine that was simply false (below, `map`). Everything in
this section is a measurement against `origin/main` @ `70367ab`, reproducible by
running `test/integration/invariants/semantic-structure.test.js`.

The headline: **the foundation is clean and the map is still unbuilt.** Nothing in
§4A has landed. But nothing has rotted either — every invariant the retag depends on
holds today, which is exactly why the gates could land first.

### 17.1 The measured baseline (gallery, 117 slides)

| Invariant | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| every slide is a `<section>` | 117 / 117 | ✅ clean |
| nested `<section>` inside a slide | 0 | ✅ clean — no `section.<name>` collisions |
| `<header>` per slide | max 1 (101 total) | ✅ holds **because the Cells are still `<div>`** — see 17.3 |
| `<footer>` per slide | max 1 (116 total) | ✅ same caveat |
| `<article>` anywhere | 0 | the deck container and leaf cards are both unbuilt |
| `<figure>` anywhere | 0 (5 literals in `lib/**`, none on a gallery path) | unbuilt |
| `aria-hidden` over authored prose | **0** | ✅ the §10-I1 regression is not present |
| nameless reachable landmarks | **0** | ✅ clean zero — the budget starts at 0 |
| `aria-hidden` `<nav>` | **84** | ⚠ a new over-tagging finding — 17.4 |

### 17.2 Shipped since §15 (credit where due)

- **G2 is closed.** The export shell emits `<html lang>` + `<title>`
  (`lattice-emulator.js:1837-1838`).
- **The player's icon-button debt is closed.** `player-core.mjs:961-963` now carries
  real `aria-label`s (`Present` / `Read · Slides` / `Read · Article`), not the
  `title`-only naming §15.1 flagged.

### 17.3 Still unbuilt — the whole §4A map, with fresh citations

| Target | Current state |
|---|---|
| deck container → `<article>` | still `<div class="lattice">` — `lib/engine/slides.js:229` |
| `css.js` lockstep | still `div.lattice > section` — `lib/engine/css.js:104,117,125,144,149,150` |
| masthead Cell → `<header>` | still `<div class="cell-masthead">` — `masthead.transform.js:325` |
| carousel lockstep hazard | **real, unchanged** — `carousel.js:61,195` regex the literal `<div class="cell-masthead">` |
| export shell `<main>` + skip link | absent |
| player shell `<main>` | absent — `#lp-app` / `#lp-stage` are `<div>`s |
| player TOC name | **still nameless** — `<nav id="lp-toc">`, `player-core.mjs:985` |
| Studio `<main>` | **still zero**, as it has been since the original note |
| axe gate (G10) | no `axe-core` in the dependency tree |

The nested-`<footer>` collision §15.3 predicted is confirmed *by construction*: the
≤1-per-slide invariant holds today only because the Cells are `<div>`s. The moment
`.cell-footer` → `<footer>` lands, the absorbed running directive nests inside it.
That is now a **failing test** rather than a prediction — which is the point of
landing the gates first.

### 17.4 Correction 1 — the `aria-hidden` allowlist (§8-#4) is unimplementable as written

§8-#4 specified a gate keyed on `SANCTIONED_ARIA_HIDDEN = {.backdrop, .image-scrim,
.lattice-bg}`. **Reality: `aria-hidden` appears at 65 source sites and 160 rendered
nodes**, and the overwhelming majority are *correct* — SVG grid groups, legend
swatches, decorative dots and rails. A three-class allowlist would fail on ~157
legitimate nodes on day one, so it would have been widened until it meant nothing.

**The gate is redesigned to key on the failure mode instead of the class list:** an
`aria-hidden` subtree must not contain authored prose (`h1`–`h6`, `p`, `li`, `td`,
`th` with text). That is the actual defect §10-I1 caught — `.image-text` hiding the
author's `<h2>` — and it catches it regardless of which class carries it, which the
allowlist could not. Measured baseline: **0 offenders.**

### 17.5 Correction 2 — the `<figure>` conversion is blocked on a problem §16 doesn't name

§7 lists three hazards for the chart `<figure>` work (UA margin, the
`div.functionplot` JS selector, the CSS `:is(…figure…)` leak). There is a fourth, and
it is the one that matters — **measured on the rendered gallery, not grepped:**

| Root SVG | `aria-hidden` | `role` | named? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `funnel-svg` | **true** | `img` | **no** |
| `quadrant-svg` | **true** | `img` | **no** |
| `wc-svg` (word-cloud) | false | — | **no** |
| `gantt` · `piechart` · `radar` · `map` · `state-chart` | false | `img` | bare child `<title>` |
| `journey-face` · `journey-curve` | true | — | decorative, correct |

**`funnel` and `quadrant` are entirely absent from the accessibility tree** — the
root SVG is `role="img" aria-hidden="true"`, and every label lives inside it. Their
`.funnel-figure` / `.quadrant-figure` wrappers contain *nothing else*. So retagging
those wrappers to `<figure>` would announce **"figure"** and then present an empty
region — measurably worse than today's silence, because it advertises content that
isn't there.

Two further corrections this measurement forces:

- **A grep-derived claim of mine was wrong.** `map.transform.js:304` does emit an
  `aria-hidden` SVG root, but the gallery's map does **not** render through that
  branch — the shipped `map-svg` is not hidden and carries a `<title>`. Source greps
  overstate this problem; only the render settles it. (§16 should be re-derived the
  same way.)
- **The seven `<title>`-named SVGs use exactly the pattern §14 already flagged as
  unreliable** — a bare child `<title>`, which VoiceOver/Safari and older JAWS drop.
  They need the `aria-labelledby`-referenced form. So "named" in the table above
  means *named in the DOM*, not *reliably announced*.

**Consequence for sequencing:** the `<figure>` commit (§13 step 4) now depends on
first settling the SVG naming story — un-hide `funnel`/`quadrant` with a real
accessible name, name `wc-svg`, and move the bare `<title>`s to the id-referenced
form. That is a *prerequisite*, not a follow-up: `<figure>` over an unnamed or
hidden graphic is not a semantic win. **§16's per-component table is also stale** —
`matrix-grid-figure` and `scene-figure` are new wrappers it never listed, and the
chart family went all-SVG on 2026-07-27 (`2026-07-27-chart-family-all-svg.md`).
Re-derive it from a render before implementing.

### 17.6 Correction 3 — a new over-tagging instance the rubric should have caught

The progress rail emits **`<nav class="tile-progress" aria-hidden="true">`** — 84 of
them in the gallery. That is self-contradictory: it claims the `navigation` role and
then removes itself from the accessibility tree. It is not *harmful* (the hiding
wins, so there is no landmark flood — the measured nameless-landmark count is 0), but
it is the exact over-tagging §3 forbids, and it is the honest `<div>` case: a
decorative duplicate of the pagination.

The retag is class-keyed in CSS and byte-neutral, but **not a pure tag-swap** — a
string-literal consumer matches the opening tag (`lib/core/split-envelope.js:129`),
the same hazard shape as `carousel.js`. So it is landmark work, not gate work: the
gate seeds an **exceed-only budget at 84** so it cannot grow, and the budget drops to
0 when the rail retag lands with its lockstep edit.

### 17.7 What landed, and what is next

**Landed (step 1 of the §13 sequence — the gates):**
`test/integration/invariants/semantic-structure.test.js` — six invariants over the
rendered gallery (slide-stays-`<section>`, no nested `<section>`, ≤1
`<header>`/`<footer>` per slide, `<article>` only on a sanctioned class with an
anti-rot check, no `aria-hidden` prose, no nameless landmark + the hidden-`<nav>`
ratchet). Each was **mutation-tested** — a synthetic violation of every one was
confirmed to fail the gate, with a named control confirming no false positive. It
runs in the per-PR tier, needs no browser, and takes ~2s.

**Next, in order:** (2) the byte-neutral landmarks — export shell `<main>` + skip
link, player shell `<main>` + TOC name, Studio `<main>`, the `nav.tile-progress`
retag with its `split-envelope.js` lockstep; (3) the engine container + Cell retags
with the `css.js` and `carousel.js` lockstep edits, pixel-diffed; (4) the SVG naming
prerequisite, *then* `<figure>`; (5) the sign-off demo deck. Steps 3–5 change export
bytes and merge only after human sign-off (QUALITY BAR).

**Still unverified, and named as such** (HARD RULE #23): no screen reader has been
run against any of this. jsdom proves DOM shape, nothing more. The G10 axe gate is
still absent, and NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver remain unreachable from this sandbox.

### 17.8 Step 2 landed — the landmarks, and what the retag actually cost

**Shipped:** a `<main>` on all three shells, a shared skip link, the player's TOC name
and "Slide N of M" counter, and both progress rails demoted from `<nav>` to `<div>`.

**Verified on the real running Studio** (HARD RULE #23 — the build, driven in Chromium
at 1440/820/390px, not a harness): exactly one `<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">`
at every width and on every view branch; the skip link is the FIRST tabbable element;
pressing Enter **moves focus** to `<main>`, not merely the viewport — the classic
skip-link half-fix §8-#7 warns about does not apply here; zero nameless landmarks.
Screenshots at all three widths show no layout change.

Three corrections to what this note predicted:

- **§5's "four view branches" is right in shape, wrong in membership.** The branches are
  now Fabricate · landscape-phone cinema · mobile · the unified compose spine. The
  desktop/focus/mobile split §5 lists was consolidated by the spine hoist.
- **The Studio has NO `<aside>` elements**, so §10-R3's constraint (an `<aside>` keeps
  its landmark role inside `<main>`, so it must be a sibling) is currently moot — the
  docked panels are `ResizablePanel` divs. The `<main>` is still scoped to leave the
  activity-bar `<nav>` outside, because that constraint DOES bind for `<nav>`, and it
  keeps the shape correct if a panel is ever promoted.
- **`ResizablePanelGroup` cannot be retagged** — react-resizable-panels' `Group` renders
  its own `div` and exposes no tag prop — so the compose spine uses the wrapper §5
  sanctions for the app surface. Retag was available on the other three branches.

**The rail demotion cost more than a tag swap, exactly as §15.3 warned for the Cells.**
`split-envelope.js` recognized chrome by TAG NAME (`header`/`footer`/`nav`), so demoting
the rails made `injectTrailing` stop seeing the trailing chrome run — and a split run's
below-note landed AFTER the section's own footer and rail. A unit test caught it; nothing
would have failed to compile. Chrome detection is now **role-based** — tag, or the marker
class each rail owns (`CHROME_CLASS_RE`) — so the identity a future retag changes is no
longer the identity the parser depends on. Three more string-literal consumers needed the
same lockstep treatment (`auto-split.js`'s rail-stripping regex, and two test fixtures).

**This is the third confirmed instance of one pattern**, and it is now the main risk to
step 3: *this codebase parses its own rendered HTML with tag-anchored regexes.*
`carousel.js:61,195` (masthead), `split-envelope.js` (rails, chrome run),
`auto-split.js:171` (rails). Every retag in §4A has to be treated as a parser change, and
the fix is always the same — key on the class, which is the stable identity.

**Budget update:** `HIDDEN_NAV_BUDGET` seeded at 84 in step 1 and is now **0**, enforced
as a flat invariant rather than a ratchet. The gallery renders zero `<nav>` elements.

### 17.9 Step 4a landed — every chart SVG is now named

The `<figure>` prerequisite from §17.5, done. Measured on a gallery render before and
after:

| Root SVG | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `funnel-svg` | `aria-hidden`, no name | `role="img"` + `<title>` + `<desc>` listing the stages |
| `quadrant-svg` (4 variant roots) | `aria-hidden`, no name | `role="img"` + a per-variant `<title>` |
| `wc-svg` | no `role`, no name | `role="img"` + `<title>` + `<desc>` in weight order |
| the other 7 | `role="img"` + `<title>` | unchanged |

**Unnamed chart-root SVGs: 3 → 0** (funnel, quadrant, word-cloud). *An earlier draft
said "reachable-but-unnamed: 4 → 0", which the checker refuted: funnel and quadrant were
`aria-hidden` on `main`, i.e. NOT reachable, so only `wc-svg` was reachable-and-unnamed.
The honest numbers are **1 → 0** reachable-unnamed or **3 → 0** unnamed chart roots; the
two framings were conflated to produce a bigger number.*

**Root cause — CORRECTED 2026-07-28 (the checker refuted my first account).** I wrote
that these "got *worse* over time": that their roots were `aria-hidden` back when the
labels lived in HTML beside the SVG, and that the all-SVG migration
(`2026-07-27-chart-family-all-svg.md`) moved the labels behind the existing
`aria-hidden`. **That story is false in both halves, and it blamed an innocent commit.**

Checked against git history:

- **The funnel was born this way.** `7884d6f1` (2026-06-09, #111 — the commit that
  *introduces* the funnel) already emits `role="img" aria-hidden="true"` on the root
  **and** `<text class="funnel-label">` / `funnel-value` / `funnel-conv` inside it.
- **The quadrant was born this way.** `bd20b434` (2026-05-15) `openSvg` is already
  `role="img" aria-hidden="true"` with `quadrant-label` / `quadrant-dot-label` already
  `<text>` inside.
- **The cited migration never touched either file.** `1d85d1d2` changes `svg-legend.js`,
  `radar.*`, `chart-family.js` and a gallery — not `funnel`, not `quadrant`.

So these were **original oversights, roughly two months old**, not regressions. The fix
is unchanged and still right; the *story* was wrong, and a confident causal account is
exactly what becomes institutional memory if left standing.

Worth naming why I got it wrong: the regression story was more interesting, it fit a
pattern I had just found elsewhere on this branch, and I never ran `git log` on the
files. A causal claim needs history, not plausibility.

**A test was pinning the defect.** `funnel.test.js` asserted
`assert.match(html, /aria-hidden="true"/)` — the suite would have failed if anyone
*fixed* it. Replaced with the inverse assertion plus the reasoning, so the fix is now
what's locked in.

**Still open, deliberately.** Seven charts remain named by a **bare child `<title>`** —
the pattern §14 flags as unreliable on VoiceOver/Safari and older JAWS. Moving all ten to
the `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby` id-referenced form is a uniform, mechanical pass
that needs document-unique ids, and it is cleaner as its own commit than smuggled into
this one. So charts are now named **in the DOM**; "reliably announced" is a further step,
and this note does not claim it. Nor does any of this close **G5**: a title plus a stage
list is not the same as a data table, and a `<desc>` is a description, not a structure a
user can navigate.

**Byte impact:** the rendered PDF/PNG is visually identical (neither `<title>` nor
`<desc>` paints — verified on a real funnel + quadrant render), but the exported HTML and
therefore the PDF bytes do change. It rides the step-5 sign-off with the rest.

### 17.10 Step 3, part 1 — the container is an `<article>`; the Cell retags are NOT worth it

**Done: `div.lattice` → `article.lattice`** (§4A "article #1", Fork D). `slides.js`
emits the new tag and `css.js` moves in lockstep — `scaffold()` (5 rule blocks / 6 selector positions — an earlier draft said "7 rules", counting a comment occurrence) and
`packSelector` step 3 both emit `article.lattice > section`, preserving the (0,1,2)
specificity that has to beat the preview frame's `.lattice > section` sizing rule
(`article` is a type selector exactly like `div`, so the specificity cost is nil).
Verified: gallery container renders as `ARTICLE`, one per document, 117 slides;
`packTheme('section.title')` → `article.lattice > section.title`; **PDF pages
pixel-identical to `origin/main`.**

Four live consumers needed the lockstep edit — and one of them would have been an
expensive silent failure:

| Consumer | Why it mattered |
|---|---|
| `share-export.ts` — strips the `div.lattice > ` prefix when un-scoping deck CSS for the player | A miss here ships the **full stylesheet with none of it matching** → the .html export renders as raw unstyled Markdown |
| `PrintOptionsPanel.tsx` — builds its own container per slide | Print path would lose every themed rule |
| `check-viz-render.js` — composes its own document | The viz gate would silently stop matching |
| `perf-torture/scenarios/studio.mjs` — heap-retainer string match | Would stop finding the container |

That is a **fourth** instance of the tag-anchored-coupling pattern (§17.8), and the
first where the consumer lives in the docs site rather than the engine.

**The gate did its job.** `semantic-structure.test.js` failed on the new
`<article class="lattice">` until it was added to `SANCTIONED_ARTICLE_CLASSES` with a
justification — which is exactly the "a new `<article>` is a deliberate decision, never
a silent emission" contract §4A asks for. Landing the gates first paid for itself here.

### 17.10a The masthead/footer Cell retags — recommend DROPPING them

§4A calls for `.cell-masthead` → `<header>` and `.cell-footer` → `<footer>`. **On
investigation these should not ship**, and the reason is in the ADR's own text:

**They buy nothing.** §3 states that `<header>`/`<footer>` **degrade to generic inside
a sectioning element** — and the slide IS a `<section>`. The ADR calls this "a feature"
because it stops 40 banners flooding the landmark map. But the corollary it never draws
is that the retag therefore adds **no landmark, no role, and nothing an assistive
technology can perceive.** The benefit is aesthetic: the DOM reads more honestly.

**They cost a lot, and the footer one risks a regression:**

- The running `footer:` directive nests *inside* the cell, so
  `.cell-footer` → `<footer>` yields `<footer class="cell-footer"><footer>…</footer></footer>`
  — which the §8-#8 gate correctly fails. The ADR's fix is to demote the inner
  `<footer>`, but **six live CSS rules key on that element**:
  `section.form > .cell-footer > footer`,
  `section[data-split-role="cover"] > .cell-footer > footer` (×2, deliberately doubled
  for weight). Demoting it breaks **chrome suppression** — the `silent`/`no-footer`
  behavior that already shipped broken once for a full release and now has a dedicated
  real-browser test.

  *(Enumeration CORRECTED 2026-07-28 — the checker found my original list named the
  wrong rules. The count "six" is right, but I listed `section.silent > footer` and
  `section.no-footer > footer` from `base.variants.css:38-39`, which are a direct
  `> footer` child of the SECTION, not inside `.cell-footer` — and that file's own
  comment says they never match the Form path. The actual six blocks containing
  `.cell-footer > footer` are `stage.css:214`, `stage.css:260-261` (the `no-footer` /
  `silent` pair), `stage.css:419` (`claim-hero`), `stage.css:455` (`claim-bleed`),
  `base.modifiers.css:1405` and `base.modifiers.css:1581`. My list omitted precisely
  the chrome-suppression rules the argument rests on, while citing rules that don't
  apply. Conclusion unchanged; the citation was wrong.)*
- `footer-dock.js` finds the cell's close via a depth-aware `</div>` matcher
  (`matchingDivClose`), which would need to become tag-aware.
- `carousel.js:61,195` match `<div class="cell-masthead">…</div>\s*</div>` — regexes
  that depend on both the tag AND the div-nesting depth.
- `split-envelope.js` builds its own `.cell-footer`, and ~12 test fixtures assert the
  literal open tags.

**So: high blast radius across the cascade, four more tag-anchored consumers, a real
chance of reintroducing a shipped-broken chrome bug — in exchange for zero perceivable
accessibility gain.** That fails the QUALITY BAR's own cost test and HARD RULE #18's
"never ship a regression you created". The container retag (real semantic value, the
deck genuinely IS a self-contained composition) is kept; the Cell retags are
**recommended for removal from §4A** rather than deferred, because deferring implies
they are still owed.

If they are ever revisited, the honest design is: the Cell **is** the footer, so the
running directive's text becomes `<div class="footer-text">` inside
`<footer class="cell-footer">`, and all six `> footer` rules re-key to it — one
coordinated cascade change with the chrome-suppression test as its gate, not a tag swap.

### 17.11 A new gap, found and FIXED — all math was invisible to screen readers (G12)

Investigating the third-party renderers before the `<figure>` work turned up something
the register never had: **every formula in an exported deck was absent from the
accessibility tree.**

KaTeX renders two halves — a visual one it marks `aria-hidden="true"`, and a MathML
alternative meant to be what AT actually reads. The emulator created its engine with
`mathOutput:'html'`, which emits the visual half and **drops the MathML**. The result:
the hidden half hidden, and nothing in its place. Display math and inline math alike.

The reasoning in the code was that MathML "can't be read in a PDF and its unclipped
layout trips the slide overflow watcher (a stale ring)". **Both halves were re-tested on
real renders and neither reproduces:**

| Check | `html` | `htmlAndMathml` |
|---|---|---|
| overflow-flagged slides, 4-formula dense deck | 0 | **0** |
| rasterized PDF pages | — | **pixel-identical** |
| `<annotation>` alternatives emitted | 0 | **2 of 2** |

`katex.min.css` — linked into this very shell — clips `.katex-mathml` out of the flow, so
the accessible alternative costs no layout and no pixels. The PDF half of the claim is
true but harmless.

**The worst part was WHICH path had it.** `lib/engine` never overrode the default, so the
preview was fine; only the **export** dropped MathML — the artifact people ship, and the
one G1/G6 designate as the accessible route for users the fixed canvas fails. Fixed: the
emulator now uses `htmlAndMathml`.

I originally generalized this as "two of the three worst holes were **regressions**
created by a reasonable-sounding local optimization". **That does not survive §17.9's
correction** — funnel and quadrant were original oversights, present from the commits
that introduced them, not regressions. What the three holes actually share is simpler
and worse: **nothing ever watched the accessibility tree**, so a defect could ship on
day one (funnel, quadrant) or be introduced later (this one) and no gate could tell the
difference. Still the argument for G10's axe gate, which still does not exist.

### 17.12 Third-party renderers — the policy for `<figure>` and naming

Mermaid, KaTeX and function-plot emit markup **we do not author**, and each already has
(or lacks) its own accessibility model. The rule:

- **KaTeX — do NOT wrap in `<figure>`, do not touch its internals.** It ships a complete
  model (`aria-hidden` visual half + MathML alternative). Our only job is not to break
  it, which is exactly what §17.11 fixes. A `<figure>` around a formula would add an
  announced "figure" boundary around something that is inline prose content.
- **Mermaid — name it, don't restructure it.** mmdc emits `role="graphics-document
  document"` with **no accessible name** unless the author wrote `accTitle:`/`accDescr:`
  in the diagram source. Added a conservative floor: when the SVG carries no
  `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` and no `<title>` of its own, label it with the diagram's
  TYPE ("Flowchart", "Sequence diagram", …) read from the source. An authored name is
  never overwritten. A type is a floor, not a description — `accTitle:`/`accDescr:`
  remain the right way to say what a diagram *means*, and that belongs in the authoring
  docs. **Verified on a real mmdc render** — `<svg aria-label="Flowchart"
  id="lattice-mmd-1" …>` — after the regression in §17.13 was fixed. (An earlier draft of
  this section marked it UNVERIFIED because mermaid appeared to be broken in the sandbox;
  it was broken BY this change, which §17.13 records.)
- **function-plot — the JS selectors must be de-tagged BEFORE any `<figure>` retag.**
  `runtime/index.js` and `lattice-emulator.js` both select
  `div.functionplot[data-fp-config]` **by tag**; retagging without changing them stops
  plots rendering silently. This is the same tag-anchored-coupling pattern as §17.8 and
  §17.10, now at five confirmed instances.

**Consequence for 4b:** the `<figure>` conversion applies to **our own single-graphic
chart wrappers only**. Mermaid keeps its own root (naming, not wrapping); KaTeX is out of
scope entirely; function-plot is gated behind the selector fix.

### 17.13 A regression I caused, and the trap that hid it

The mermaid naming change (§17.12) **broke mermaid rendering outright** — every diagram
in every export fell back to a `<pre>`. Caught by `export-formats` (21/27 vs main's
27/27, same sandbox, quiet machine), fixed before push. Worth recording because the
*diagnosis* was the hard part, not the fix.

**The bug:** the injection called the module's `escapeHtml`, declared far below as a
`const`. The mermaid pre-pass runs during module evaluation, so reaching forward to it
threw `Cannot access 'escapeHtml' before initialization` — a temporal-dead-zone error in
a file whose top-to-bottom reading order gives no hint that this function runs that
early.

**The trap — why it looked like something else entirely.** `renderMermaidOne` wraps the
mmdc call AND the post-processing in one `try`, with a 3-attempt retry. But
`fs.rmSync(tmpDir)` runs BEFORE the post-processing. So:

1. attempt 1 — mmdc succeeds, my code throws, temp dir is already deleted;
2. attempts 2–3 — mmdc re-runs against a **deleted input file** and fails for real;
3. the loop reports the LAST error: `Command failed: … mmdc …`.

The surfaced message therefore blamed mmdc, and mmdc was innocent — it ran fine
standalone, which sent me looking for an environment problem for several minutes. **A
post-processing error was laundered into a renderer error by cleanup-before-use plus
retry.** I only found it by temporarily printing the caught error inside the loop.

Three things this is worth remembering for:

- **"Failed after N attempts" hides the first failure**, which is usually the real one.
  A retry loop should distinguish "the operation failed" from "the operation succeeded
  and what we did next failed" — the second must not be retried at all.
- **Cleanup that precedes post-processing makes a retry unsound.** The retry can never
  succeed after the first pass consumed the inputs.
- **A worktree baseline settles authorship fast.** main 27/27 vs HEAD 21/27 in the same
  sandbox took one command and turned "probably the flaky sandbox" into "definitely
  mine" — HARD RULE #18's who-caused-it test, applied literally.

The fix escapes locally instead of reaching forward, and the label table is ours and
fixed, so escaping is belt-and-braces rather than a security boundary. The `<svg
aria-label="Flowchart" id="lattice-mmd-1" …>` output is now verified on a REAL mmdc
render, which upgrades §17.12's UNVERIFIED note.

### 17.14 ARIA best-practice audit — the rules, and what they found

A rules-based sweep over the rendered gallery, the assembled player, and the LIVE
Studio (real Chromium, 1440 + 390px). Eleven rules; three findings, all fixed.

| Rule | Result |
|---|---|
| `aria-label` on a `role=generic` element (spec says IGNORED) | **3 found — fixed** |
| `role` + `aria-hidden="true"` on the same node | 0 (the funnel/quadrant fix cleared them) |
| focusable content inside an `aria-hidden` subtree | 0 |
| redundant `role=` duplicating native semantics | 0 |
| `aria-labelledby` / `aria-describedby` → missing id | 0 |
| duplicate `id` | 0 |
| `role="img"` with an empty accessible name | 0 |
| heading-level jumps within a slide | 0 |
| unknown `aria-*` attribute names | 0 |
| `<svg>` with a `<title>` but no `role` | 0 |
| unnamed interactive control (live Studio, both widths) | 0 |

**Finding 1 — the state-chart index badge (fixed).** `<span class="state-index"
aria-label="on-track">` put a label on a bare `<span>`, whose implicit role is
`generic` — and ARIA says a label on a generic role is **ignored**. So the status
reached no assistive technology at all, while sighted users got it from **hue alone**
(WCAG 1.4.1). Two further problems in the same three lines:

- a status-**less** badge was `aria-hidden="true"`, hiding the state's *identifier* —
  the number every transition routes by (`byFrom.get(s.index)`), not decoration;
- had the label applied, `aria-label="on-track"` would have **replaced** the visible
  numeral rather than added to it, trading the id away for the status.

Now `role="img"` (which makes the label apply) with a name carrying **both** facts:
`aria-label="State 2, on-track"`. Locked by a new regression test.

**Finding 2 — the player's decorative chrome icons (fixed).** Twelve inline 24×24
icon SVGs in the tab bar, nav arrows and toggles carried no `aria-hidden`. Their
buttons already have `aria-label`s, so the icons never corrupted a *name* — but an
un-hidden inline SVG can still surface in an AT graphics rotor as noise. Now
`aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"` (the latter keeps legacy engines from tabbing
in). Player golden re-blessed.

**Finding 3 — a gap in my own gate.** The §17.7 "no `aria-hidden` over authored prose"
check looks for `h1`–`h6`/`p`/`li`/`td`/`th` descendants. The state-chart badge hid a
*numeral held as the span's own text*, so the gate never saw it. Structural gates
check the shapes you thought of; this one is a reminder that they are a floor.

**Two things the audit deliberately did NOT flag:**

- **Unnamed `<header>` and `<main>` in the Studio.** `banner`, `main` and `contentinfo`
  do not need accessible names when there is exactly one of each — naming them adds
  rotor noise for no navigational gain. The `<nav>` that *does* need a name has one
  ("Slide navigator", "Studio panels", "Slides").
- **`aria-label` duplicating visible text on the player's view tabs.** Normally
  redundant, but `.lp-tab-text` is `sr-only` at narrow widths, so the label is
  load-bearing there — and the two strings match exactly, so voice control still works.

### 17.15 The adversarial trio — inversion pass, and the six defects it found

Run against the shipped diff. The inversion lens found **six real defects**, four of
them things this branch itself introduced. All fixed; each is recorded because the
*pattern* matters more than the individual bug.

**1. `role="img"` prunes the subtree — the naming work half-undid itself.** This is the
big one. `role="img"` is children-presentational: the entire subtree leaves the
accessibility tree. So `<title>Quadrant chart</title>` with no `<desc>` announced
"Quadrant chart, image" over **18 pruned `<text>` nodes** — axis names, the four
quadrant names, every item. §17.5 rejects `<figure>`-over-a-hidden-graphic on exactly
this reasoning ("advertises content that isn't there") and then this section did the
same thing with a different element. Fixed: quadrant emits a `<desc>` carrying axes,
quadrant names and every item with its position.

**2. The funnel `<desc>` dropped the conversion rates.** It listed stage values only —
so the percentages, the thing a funnel EXISTS to show, were unreachable by any route
once `role="img"` pruned the `<text>` nodes. CHANGELOG had explicitly named
"conversion percentage" among the things being fixed. Now included, joined with `;`
because a stage label may itself contain a comma ("Logged, with the decision").

**3. A FIFTH container consumer, missed.** `docs/src/playground/snapshot-cache.js`
synthesized `doc.createElement('div')` for the captured wrapper instead of mirroring
the live element. The CSS captured with it is scoped `article.lattice > section`, so
the Playground's returning-visitor first paint replayed a full stylesheet that matched
nothing — raw unstyled Markdown. **This is verbatim the failure §17.10 congratulates
itself for catching in `share-export.ts`.** Finding the pattern four times did not stop
me missing the fifth. Its test asserted `/^<div class="lattice">/` and PASSED, because
the source hardcoded the div — a test pinning a now-wrong contract, the same
anti-pattern §17.9 celebrates removing from `funnel.test.js`, reintroduced in the same
branch.

**4. `isChrome` over-matched two ways.** §17.8's stated lesson was "key on the class,
which is the stable identity". The implementation keyed on a *substring of serialized
HTML*, which is weaker than what it replaced:
- `\b` treats `-` as a word boundary, so `tile-progress-legend`, `foo-tile-progress`
  and `lat-split-rail-x` all matched;
- `el.outer` is outer HTML **including descendants**, so any block CONTAINING a rail
  became chrome — and the rail docks inside `.cell-footer`, so every footer cell
  silently changed classification and trailing notes moved.

Fixed to match the element's OWN open tag on WHOLE class tokens. **The lesson needs
restating: keying on the class beats keying on the tag only if the match is exact.**

**5. A self-contradicting CHANGELOG sentence** ("would not run in the sandbox … so the
guard and injection are verified on a real render") — the worst possible shape under
HARD RULE #23, since a reader cannot tell what was verified. My edit welded a
correction onto a stale draft instead of replacing it.

**6. `engineering/gotchas.md` was never updated** — 8 live citations still taught
`div.lattice > section`, including the specificity worked example the container retag
invalidated. A CLAUDE.md rule 6 violation (docs in the same change), in the symptom
index every agent is told to read first.

#### The structural criticism, which I accept

**Two of the six gates are vacuous.** The engine gallery renders zero
`nav`/`aside`/`main`/`form`, so "every reachable landmark has an accessible name" and
"no `<nav>` is aria-hidden" both assert over an EMPTY SET — the latter *because* this
branch demoted the only two `<nav>`s in the deck. And **no gate covers the three shells
where the landmarks actually landed** (export shell, player, Studio); the gate renders
`lib/engine` only. The `SANCTIONED_ARTICLE_CLASSES` contract — "a new `<article>` is
never a silent emission" — is therefore false for two of three surfaces: the player
emits `<article id="lp-article">` ungated.

Related: the aria-hidden-prose gate scans `h1-h6/p/li/td/th`, so it is **structurally
incapable** of seeing the funnel/quadrant defect it was written alongside (SVG `<text>`
inside a hidden `<svg>`), and blind to `role="img"` pruning — now the dominant hiding
mechanism in this codebase, and ungated.

**The honest conclusion: an `axe-core` gate over all three shells (G10) is worth more
than the six hand-written jsdom gates, and would have caught the nameless TOC, the
nameless SVGs, and the `aria-live`/`aria-label` conflict.** G10 should be the next
thing built, not a backlog row.

#### What survived the attack

The MathML re-enable was attacked from four angles — PDF text layer (`pdftotext` on
both: byte-identical), file size (+1,771 bytes HTML, +175 PDF), duplicate announcement
(KaTeX hides its own visual half), and PPTX (raster, unaffected) — and **held on all
four**. One residual worth noting: `katex.min.css` is resolved in a `try`, and on
Chromium 109+ unclipped MathML renders natively — so if that stylesheet ever fails to
resolve, the formula now renders TWICE where it previously rendered once unstyled.
Tracked, not fixed here.

§17.10a's recommendation to drop the Cell retags was independently confirmed against
the HTML-AAM mapping: `<footer>` maps to `contentinfo` only when its nearest
sectioning ancestor is `body`; inside `<section>` it is `generic`. No landmark, no
role, nothing perceivable.

### 17.16 The adversarial trio — red team + checker. Two criticals, and the gate that should have existed

The red team and independent checker returned after §17.15. Between them they found
**two critical/high defects this branch shipped**, plus a factual error in §17.9 that
mattered more than either.

#### CRITICAL — the sanctioned `<main>` wrapper broke the `--fluid` viewer completely

`base.fluid-view.css` makes `<body>` a centred flex column and sizes each slide
`width: min(100%, 100dvh * var(--fill-max-aspect))`. That percentage resolves against
the slide's **parent**. Interposing `<main id="deck">` made body's `align-items:center`
shrink-to-fit it, the percentage then resolved against a content-derived width, and
**every slide collapsed to 0px**. The viewer self-activates on load, so a recipient
double-clicking the exported `.html` saw a blank page. Verified in Chromium:
`[{w:0,h:900},{w:0,h:900}]` on this branch vs `[{w:1440,h:900}]` on `main`; deleting
only the `<main>` tags restored it.

**§10-R4's safety argument was about the wrong thing.** It licensed this one wrap
because "`<main>` has no UA margin; the theme CSS is `section`-scoped". Both true, and
both irrelevant: the wrap adds no *box* and no *specificity*, but it adds a
**containing block** — which is precisely what "never wrap" (§2, reason 1) protects.
The rule was right and the exception's reasoning was incomplete.

Fixed by making `<main>` transparent to the flex column in fluid view (same axis, full
width) so slides resolve against the same box as before.

**Nothing caught it.** `npm test` (4448), `test:integration:pr` (382), lint and CI were
all green with a shipped, documented feature 100% non-functional — there is a `--fluid`
integration test, but it asserted only type-floor rings, never geometry. **It does now**
(`legibility-watcher.test.js`, three viewports), and the guard was confirmed to fail
against the reverted fix.

#### HIGH — MathML is NOT pixel-free on `math.compare`

§17.11 claimed "PDF pages pixel-identical". True on the decks measured; **false on the
one layout with CSS multi-columns**. `.katex-mathml` is `position:absolute`, and inside
a multicol Chrome still counts it as fragmentable content: the block gained an extra
EMPTY column, painting a spurious `column-rule` hairline at the right edge
(`scrollWidth` 1280 → 1872). Confirmed by rasterizing `math.gallery.md` against `main`
— page 6 differed, 224 pixels, a 1px vertical stripe — and isolated by deleting the
`.katex-mathml` nodes, which restored 1280.

**Why the original measurement missed it:** the baseline gallery has a `math` slide but
**no `math compare`**, and the overflow probe recomputes from flowed child rects, so an
*empty* column is invisible to it by construction. "0 overflow-flagged slides" was true
and proved nothing.

Fixed with `position: fixed` on `.katex-mathml` inside the compare variant — it leaves
the multicol's fragmentation flow while staying clipped, invisible and fully in the
accessibility tree. `contain` (strict/size/layout/paint), `overflow:hidden` and
`column-fill:auto` were all tested and all failed. Both flagged decks are now
pixel-identical to `main` with 90 MathML alternatives intact.

#### MEDIUM — the player stripped the MathML it was supposed to carry

DOMPurify's default MathML profile contains neither `<semantics>` nor `<annotation>`,
so `sanitizeSlideHtml` removed both from the player — 125 `<math>` elements, **zero**
annotations — and, worse, kept the annotation's TEXT, leaving raw LaTeX as a bare text
node inside `<math>` for an AT to read aloud. So the accessibility win §17.11 counts was
absent from the primary shared artifact. Both tags added to the allowlist;
**`annotation-xml` deliberately excluded** (a known mXSS vector DOMPurify guards on
purpose, and KaTeX never emits it). Verified the guard still strips `annotation-xml`,
`<script>` and `on*`.

#### The §17.9 root-cause story was false — see the correction there

The checker refuted it against git history: funnel (`7884d6f1`, 2026-06-09) and quadrant
(`bd20b434`, 2026-05-15) shipped `aria-hidden` **with** their `<text>` labels already
inside, and the all-SVG commit I blamed never touched either file. They were original
oversights, not regressions, and §17.11's generalization was corrected with them.

#### Other findings folded in

- **The stale-sanction gate was vacuous** — it searched only *inside* slides, where
  neither sanctioned class can appear. Mutation-confirmed: demoting the container to a
  `<div>` left all ten assertions green. Rewritten to search the whole document, assert
  the container specifically, and **report its own coverage** so an unexercised entry is
  named rather than silently counted as verified.
- **Mermaid front matter** — `mermaidKindLabel` skipped the `---` fences but not the
  YAML body, so every front-mattered diagram fell through to "Diagram". 12 of the repo's
  100 mermaid blocks use front matter, **including the gallery diagram §17.12 cited as
  proof this worked**. Fixed and re-verified on a real mmdc render.
- **The retry-laundering trap §17.13 diagnosed was never actually fixed** — the cleanup
  still preceded post-processing inside the retried `try`. Now post-processing has its
  own `try`: a throw there degrades to the un-decorated SVG and says so, instead of
  masquerading as an mmdc failure. Verified with a synthetic throw.
- **The rail regex was non-greedy over a nestable tag** — safe today (the rail holds
  only `<span>`s) but a `<div>` child would silently truncate it. Now reuses
  `footer-dock`'s depth-aware matcher (HARD RULE #15) rather than a second weaker one.
- **§17.10a's CSS enumeration named the wrong rules** (count right, list wrong — it
  omitted the chrome-suppression rules its own argument rests on). Corrected in place.
- **The "4 → 0" headline was inflated** — funnel and quadrant were `aria-hidden` on
  `main`, so not *reachable*; only `wc-svg` was reachable-and-unnamed. Honest: **1 → 0**
  reachable-unnamed, or **3 → 0** unnamed chart roots.

#### What survived a serious attack

The red team fuzzed 37 adversarial selector shapes through `packTheme` (leading `:is()`
with 1–3 arms, `:root`, `:where()`, `:has()`, attribute-commas, near-misses like
`sectionfoo`) with **zero structural divergence**; swept every consumer surface for
missed `div.lattice` literals and found only comments and fixtures; pixel-diffed the
full 117-slide gallery and the funnel/quadrant/word-cloud galleries at **0**; drove
hostile author text (`</desc><script>`, `<scr<b>ipt>`, entity double-escapes) through
the new `<title>`/`<desc>` emitters with no splice and no double-escape; and confirmed
the player landmarks and Studio `<main>` uniqueness in a real browser.

**The standing lesson from all three lenses is the same one, and it is not about any
individual bug:** every gate on this branch measures DOM shape, and the two worst
defects were a *layout* break and a *pixel* break that DOM-shape gates cannot see. An
`axe-core` gate over the three shells (G10) plus real geometry assertions on the fluid
viewer are worth more than the six structural invariants. One of those two now exists.

---

## 18. The three follow-ups — G10 lands, graphics get durable names, `<figure>` does not

The three items §17 left open. Two ship: the axe gate and id-referenced SVG naming.
The third — §16's `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` conversion — was built twice, measured on the
real artifacts, and **withdrawn**; §18.3 keeps the whole record because the reasoning is
worth more than the outcome.

**The through-line of this section is that every defect in it was found by an adversarial
pass and none by a gate.** Two false claims about the DOM, a caption bound to the wrong
slide, four broken surfaces, and finally a change whose every number looked right while it
made the exported PDF worse. The repo's gates measure pixels, DOM shape, and rule
conformance; not one of them can see "this element is now hiding its own contents from a
screen reader."

### 18.1 G10 — the axe gate, over the two SHIPPED shells

`test/integration/invariants/axe-a11y.test.js` runs `axe-core` (WCAG 2.0/2.1 A + AA,
plus best-practice) against the **export shell** and the **HTML player** in real
Chromium, in the per-PR tier. *(An earlier draft of this heading said "all three
shells" and the test's docblock enumerated three; the engine render is NOT tested —
the two shipped artifacts are. Corrected.)*

This is the gate all three adversarial lenses independently said was worth more than
the six hand-written invariants, and the reason is structural: those invariants encode
defects *we already understood*. Axe checks the rules someone else thought of. The
ADR's own history is the argument — three categories of content sat outside the
accessibility tree for months with every gate green.

**It found a real defect on its first run.** The player's `#lp-bar` was a `<div>`, so
the deck TITLE sat outside every landmark (`region`) — a screen reader navigating by
landmark skipped the one string that says which deck this is. Now a `<header>`; the CSS
is id-keyed, so the retag is free. **Both shells are now at zero violations**, and the
budget is zero, not a seeded ratchet — a budget above zero here would be a scoreboard.

The suite includes a **self-check**: it plants an alt-less `<img>` and asserts axe
reports it. A green a11y gate is otherwise indistinguishable from one that never
loaded — and the player's CSP does block a normal `<script src>` injection, which is
why the bundle is evaluated as source.

**Color-contrast is excluded — and the original justification for that was wrong.** I
wrote that "the repo already owns that check (`tools/check-slide-contrast.js`)". It does
not own THIS: that tool iterates `section[data-lattice-slide]` — slide content only — so
it never sees the player's chrome at player font sizes, which is exactly where G13 lives;
its own docblock deliberately exempts "the muted chrome tier (footer, pagination)"; and
no npm script or workflow invokes it. So the honest statement is that **player-chrome
contrast is currently gated by nobody**, and G13 is logged rather than covered.

**And my second reason for excluding it was worse than wrong — it was manufactured.** I
wrote that "axe's background resolution is demonstrably wrong on this layered canvas — it
reported `#fcfaf3` as the foreground for a running header whose computed color is
`#80704a`". Those are two different elements. The header axe actually flagged is on slide
57 (`split-panel watermark mirror`), and its computed color is `color(srgb 1 1 1 / 0.7)` —
near-white. **Axe was right, and it had found a real, visible defect**, which I then used
as evidence that axe was broken.

The defect: `.watermark` sets the running header/footer to on-accent ink, because on that
layout the chrome sits over the dark accent panel. `.mirror` row-reverses the panel to the
right and the absolutely-positioned chrome does not move with it — so near-white ink lands
on the cream content side at **1.11:1**, effectively invisible in the shipped PDF. Fixed in
this change (`split-panel.styles.css`, one `:not(.mirror)`), verified by rendering slide 57
and looking at it; slide 18 (the un-mirrored twin) is byte-identical before and after.

**Why the repo's own contrast tool was green on it.** `tools/check-slide-contrast.js`
parses colors with `/rgba?\(([^)]+)\)/` and skips any run it cannot parse. Chrome serves
these tokens as `color(srgb 1 1 1 / 0.7)` — the modern color-function form, which that
regex does not match — so **every text run whose color resolves through a `color()` value
is silently dropped from the audit**, contrast unknown rather than measured. That is not a
scoping choice, it is a hole, and it is logged as G15.

So the honest scoping statement is the FIRST reason alone: one gate should own contrast,
and the tool that owns it must first be fixed (G15) and then actually be run by something.
Re-enabling axe's `color-contrast` rule scoped to the player shell remains the obvious
follow-up, and on this evidence it would find things.

### 18.2 The id-referenced naming — `lib/core/svg-a11y-names.js`

§17.9 named the charts that had none, using a **bare child `<title>`** — the mechanism
§14 flags as unreliable (VoiceOver/Safari and older JAWS drop it). So the fix shipped
four new instances of the known-weak form. Closed now: every `role="img"` chart SVG
references its own `<title>`/`<desc>` via `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby`.

**Why a document-level pass and not eight kernel edits.** `aria-labelledby` takes an
*id*, and an id must be unique in the DOCUMENT. The chart kernels are per-slide,
stateless and shared across three render paths, so none can mint a document-unique id:
a per-kernel counter collides the moment two chart types share a deck, and renumbers
differently per path. Running once over the assembled document is the only place the
uniqueness invariant holds — and it keeps all eight kernels ignorant of the id space
(HARD RULE #1). Measured: 8 of 8 eligible graphics converted, 16 ids, all unique. The
two skipped both already carry an author `aria-label`, which always wins.

### 18.3 §16's `<figure>` plan — BUILT TWICE, MEASURED, AND WITHDRAWN

This section has now held four positions on one question. That is the useful part of it,
so the record keeps all four rather than tidying to the last.

1. **Retire it** — on a claim about the DOM that one render refutes. Wrong.
2. **Ship `associateCaptions` instead** — bound 4 of 11 captions to a chart on a
   *different slide*. Removed (§18.3a).
3. **Implement the retag** — broke four surfaces and shipped two validity defects.
4. **Rebuild it** — every measured number came out right, and it was still wrong.

**Position 4 is the instructive one, because nothing in the repo could see the defect.**

The rebuild fixed all six earlier defects and produced a clean scoreboard: alt-less
`/Figure` back to parity with `main`, fluid geometry restored, the dropped caption
recovered, zero orphans, both render paths agreeing on 8 of 8 inputs, gallery slides
byte-identical. Then the adversarial round opened the *shape* of the PDF rather than
counting it:

```
BRANCH — the caption's /Alt now WRAPS the chart's own name
  obj 126  /Figure  /Alt="The size ramp used to be an HTML rail, sized from…"   ← caption
    ├── obj 127  /Figure  /Alt="Word cloud"                                     ← chart name
    └── NonStruct                                                               ← caption again
```

PDF 32000-1 §14.9.3 defines `/Alt` as an alternate description of the structure element
**and its children**. So the fix that gave the figure a name to satisfy `/Alt` made the
chart's own name unreachable. On the HTML/CSS chart families (`roadmap`, `matrix-grid`)
there is no inner figure at all — the entire list of quarters and milestones ends up under
a one-sentence `/Alt`. And in Chromium's accessibility tree the same label lands twice:

```
figure  name="The size ramp used to be an HTML rail, sized from…"
  Figcaption  name=""     → the same text, as content
```

The caption is announced at the boundary — *before* the graphic it concludes — and again
after. That is verbatim the defect §18.3a deleted `associateCaptions` for: *"the caption
was then in the accessibility tree twice."* Written two sections earlier, in the same
document, by the same author, and repeated anyway.

**The justification is self-refuting, which is what settles it.** The `aria-label` was
added on the premise that *readers treat `/Figure` as atomic, so an unnamed one can
swallow the chart*. If that premise holds, an outer stage figure is harmful **whether or
not it is named** — naming only decides which information is destroyed. If it does not
hold, the alt-less figure was never the problem and the label was never needed. There is
no reading under which a stage-level `<figure>` is right. **The shape is wrong, not the
implementation.**

**And the measurement was honest while measuring the wrong thing.** "12 → 7, parity
restored" is reproducible and correct. It asks *does every figure have alt text?* and
never *is a figure now hiding content?* §18.3 had already written that lesson about
position 3 — *"the work went where the instrument pointed"* — and position 4 walked into
it again. A counter is not a criterion.

**DECISION: the retag is withdrawn from this change.** `.cell-stage` is an unconditional
`<div>`; the caption stays a `<p>`, delivered the way §18.3a already describes as correct
— in document order, immediately after the graphic, with its prose punctuation intact.

**What the follow-up should build instead**, when it is built: **one figure per graphic,
not two.** The chart's own `role="img"` element becomes the figure, named by its
`<title>`, described by its `<desc>`, with the caption bound by a **stage-scoped**
`aria-describedby`. Stage scope is exactly the slide boundary whose absence broke
`associateCaptions`, and the stage builder is now the one place on both render paths that
sees a whole stage — so the bug that killed it cannot recur. **Its acceptance criterion is
a real screen-reader pass, not a structure-element count.** Three things must be re-added
with it, each of which this round proved necessary and each of which was reverted with the
retag: the `figure:not(.cell-stage)` guard in `base.fluid-view.css`, `figcaption` in
`projectGeneric`'s block list, and a PDF-side assertion that no `/Figure` gains an `/Alt`
that shadows a named descendant.

**What this round leaves behind, and it is not nothing.** The `below-note` /
`split-envelope` stage matcher is now tag-agnostic and attribute-tolerant — a latent
defect the retag *exposed* rather than caused, and the sixth confirmed instance of this
codebase parsing its own rendered HTML with a tag-anchored matcher. That fix stays. So
does the rule it earned: **key on the class, capture the tag, balance what you captured,
and let the rest of the opening tag vary.**

### 18.3a `associateCaptions` shipped and was REMOVED in the same PR

The alternative I built instead of `<figure>` — appending the caption's id to the
graphic's `aria-describedby` — was measured against the repo's own decks and is a
**regression**. Binding by "nearest preceding `<svg>` in string order" has no slide
boundary, and many chart layouts carry a caption but contain **no SVG at all**
(`matrix-grid`, `roadmap` are HTML/CSS). Their captions walk backwards past their own
slide onto whatever chart came last:

| deck | correct | bound to a chart on a DIFFERENT slide | unbound |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gallery-jargon.md` | 1 | **3** | 0 |
| `chart-family-all-svg.md` | 3 | 0 | 2 |
| `data-viz-gallery.md` | 1 | **1** | 0 |

A radar chart on slide 27 was described with a roadmap's caption from slide 33. That is a
comprehension regression **only assistive-technology users experience** — there is no
visual symptom, and it is invisible to axe (the reference resolves; it is not dangling).
My own verification, *"both captions bound, zero dangling refs"*, checked for the one
failure mode this cannot produce.

Two further problems the round surfaced, both real: the caption was then in the
accessibility tree **twice** (inside the description and as its own paragraph), and
welding an author's editorial conclusion onto a machine-derived data summary destroys the
data/opinion distinction that a sighted reader gets for free from typography — the exact
boundary `<figcaption>` exists to preserve.

**Removed.** The caption was already delivered correctly: in document order, immediately
after the graphic, attributed, with its prose punctuation intact. The feature's value
proposition was "the data summary, then the author's so-what"; what it actually did was
"the data summary, then a different slide's so-what".

### 18.4 Gap-register updates

| Gap | Move |
|---|---|
| **G10** (no automated a11y gate) | **UPDATE 2026-08-19 (`2026-08-19-website-accessibility-gate.md`): the OTHER environment is now gated too.** This row and the docblock it summarizes are about the two shipped DECK shells; the WEBSITE — `lattice.style`, the component reference, the Playground, the Studio — had no scan of any kind, and that is where a 1:1 invisible nav label was shipping. `docs/e2e/axe-site.spec.ts` covers 12 routes at three widths in both color modes, plus the site menu open, with WCAG 2.2 in the tag set and axe's `equalRatio` incomplete promoted to a failure (an exact 1:1 is filed as `incomplete`, so a violations-only scan reported that page clean). Eight defect classes fixed. What remains open on the site side is listed in that note's §7 — one palette, twelve routes, one transient surface, and focus criteria axe cannot see. Original text follows. **PARTIALLY closed** — axe over both shipped shells, per-PR, at zero, with a self-check AND the `incomplete` bucket enforced for `duplicate-id-aria`. The exclusion list in the test's docblock is the honest one and is longer than this row was: one deck, one viewport, the player's DEFAULT view only (never Read·Article/Read·Slides, where the projection clones live), the engine render, color-contrast, and the exported PDF's tag tree — which no gate here reads at all. "Closed" overstated it, and so did the first version of this row |
| **(new) G18** | **21 duplicated `id`s survive in the player's cloned charts** — `chart-spine-N`, `pie-wedge-N`, `gantt-fill-*`, `q-tint-*`, `radar-area-*`, each referenced by `fill="url(#…)"`. `reidClone` re-ids only the ARIA-referenced ids this branch minted, so `duplicate-id-aria` correctly stays quiet and these are invisible to the gate. Pre-existing (same on `main`) and off-path, so logged rather than fixed — but a paint reference resolving to whichever copy came first is correct by luck |
| **G5** (chart data equivalence) | **partially closed** — every chart's `<desc>` is now reliably referenced, and funnel carries its conversion rates. Still not a *navigable* table; a description is read, not explored |
| **§16's `<figure>` spec** (not a gap number — an unshipped spec) | **still unshipped, now with evidence.** Built twice and withdrawn: a stage-level `<figure>` shadows the chart's own name in the tagged PDF and double-announces the caption in Chromium (§18.3). The follow-up should build one figure PER GRAPHIC with a stage-scoped `aria-describedby`, and its acceptance criterion is a screen-reader pass, not a structure-element count. *(This is NOT G11, which is video/audio captions for deaf/HoH users and remains **[LATER]**.)* |
| **(new) G17** | **A deck with speaker notes exports an UNTAGGED PDF.** `embedNotesInPdf`'s pdf-lib round-trip drops `/StructTreeRoot` entirely, so every accessibility property of the export — `/Figure`, `/Alt`, `/Lang`, heading structure — is silently absent on any deck carrying notes (`examples/gallery-jargon.pdf`, rebuilt on this branch, has none). Pre-existing and off-path here, but it means the §14 G1 row's premise ("the PDF is untagged") is half-right for the wrong reason, and any future work measured on a notes-free deck generalizes wrongly |
| **(new) G14** | **The Read·Article view drops the author's caption** and uses the slide HEADING as its `<figcaption>`, duplicating the `<h2>` above it. Found while checking whether `<figure>` was already in use — it is, on the reading surface, with the wrong content |
| **(new) G13** | **NARROWED (2026-08-18, `2026-08-18-contrast-floor-deck-scale.md`).** The SIZE half of this row is settled, by declining to grade on size at all: the rendered prober no longer grants WCAG's 3:1 large-text allowance and scores every run at 4.5:1. This row was right that canvas-unit "large" is not large to a viewer, and right that encoding a fix needs a viewing size nobody can supply — that is precisely why normalization was built, measured and DELETED. `--fs-*` is authored in `cqi` and `lib/typography/scale.js` curates three scales against TWO reference widths, so any single normalizer inflates the orientations it was not curated for (a rendered `size: story` deck grades `--fs-body` as large text). Dropping the allowance is strictly conservative and needs no viewing size. **Still open, and untouched:** the ink itself is 4.20:1 / 4.07:1 against 4.5:1, which is a `--text-muted` palette question, theme-wide and off that change's path too. Original text follows. **Running header/footer muted ink is 4.20:1 (light) / 4.07:1 (dark) — below the 4.5:1 normal-text threshold, on every shell.** An earlier draft said it "passes AA as LARGE text at export scale"; that reassurance is a page-box artifact and is withdrawn. The slide canvas is nominally **3840 CSS px wide**, so the chrome's `43.4px` clears WCAG's 24px large-text line only in canvas units — as a fraction of the slide it is 1.13%, which is ~14px on a 1280px-wide presentation and smaller again in the player. Nothing about the way a human sees it is "large". A `--text-muted` change is theme-wide and off this branch's path — logged, not fixed (HARD RULE #18's off-path rule) |
| **(new) G15** | **`tools/check-slide-contrast.js` silently skips every `color()`-valued run.** Its color parser is `/rgba?\(([^)]+)\)/`; Chrome serves some resolved tokens as `color(srgb r g b / a)`, which does not match, and an unparsed run is `continue`d rather than reported. So the tool's "N runs checked" undercounts and its green is partial. This is how a **1.11:1** header sat in the gallery unflagged (§18.1). One-line fix to the parser, plus a re-audit of whatever it then surfaces — a separate change, because the re-audit is the real work |
| **(new) G16** | **CLOSED for the gated galleries (2026-08-17, `2026-08-17-journey-stage-ink-and-contrast-gate.md`).** Every reported run was adjudicated against the rendered pixel, which is what this row asked for. The outcome: 3 were a real defect (`journey` stage labels, #1702, fixed), 4 were a bug in the prober's paint-order approximation (fixed — the split-`*` running header is legible white-on-rail, and BOTH previously-written explanations of those rows were wrong), and 2 classes are genuinely unmeasurable (a 12%-alpha decorative watermark; text over a raster backdrop the tool cannot sample). The tool now runs per-PR in `test/integration/invariants/slide-contrast.test.js` with a two-entry structural allowlist that fails both ways. Still open beyond those three galleries: the player shell, other viewports, and the `--text-muted` chrome tier (G13). Original text follows. **The 27 sub-AA text runs the contrast tool DOES report on the export shell are unadjudicated.** Most are `li::before` step counters and `image statement` headings where the tool resolves the background by climbing ancestors' `background-color` — a climb that misses a panel or pseudo-element paint, so several are likely false positives (slide 18 is a confirmed one: the tool and my own probe both call it 1.11:1, and the render shows legible cream-on-brown). "Likely" is not "checked". Each needs a look at the rendered pixel before it is dismissed or fixed |

**Unchanged and still the ceiling:** no screen reader has been run against any of this.
