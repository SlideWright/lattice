## Symptom — "our print export is about as ugly as sin"

The complaint is real, but it points at **one** of two print surfaces, and
they are not equally bad.

**The engine PDF (CLI / puppeteer) is already decent.** `lib/engine/css.js:121`
emits `@page { size: <slide-w> <slide-h>; margin: 0 }` plus a `@media print`
block that forces one slide per page and `print-color-adjust: exact` (headless
Chromium otherwise re-quantizes background fills, washing the palette out).
Every theme `@size` (`themes/*.css` header) is landscape. So the CLI PDF is
landscape, full-bleed, exact-colour, one-slide-per-page — the boardroom
artifact. Keep it.

**The web "Print" button is the ugly one.** `docs/src/playground/drawing-board-export.js:352`
is literally `doc.title = …; win.print()`, leaning on a thin print stylesheet
(`docs/src/playground/deck-preview.js:188`) that sets `@page { size: <px> <px> }`,
forces `background:#fff`, and strips shadow/radius. Then it drops the user into
the **browser's native print dialog**, whose defaults are **portrait, A4/Letter
with margins, and a URL/date header-footer**. A 16:9 landscape slide gets
shrunk into a portrait sheet with whitespace and a `localhost — 6/14/26`
footer. That is the "ugly as sin."

**The deeper gap, true of *both* surfaces: nothing survives black-and-white.**
Every palette encodes meaning in **hue** — `--cat-1..12`, `--chart-*`,
`--diagram-band-1..12`, the tint/mark treatments. On a grayscale office printer
two tints that differ only in hue collapse to the *same gray*: comparison
tables, tinted cards, and chart series go mushy and unreadable. There is no
print/monochrome token band anywhere in the codebase. A deck that looks 10/10
on screen can reach the boardroom as a stack of indistinguishable grays.

## Decision frame (resolved 2026-06-14)

Three forks were put to the owner and answered:

1. **Print target → "Both, paper-first."** Treat *physical paper* (someone hits
   ⌘P on an office printer) as the demanding case; let a clean digital PDF fall
   out of it.
2. **B&W survivability → "Dedicated print theme mode."** A curated print/monochrome
   token band per theme where category distinction comes from **border, rule,
   weight, and pattern**, not hue — not an auto de-hue, not color-only.
3. **Scope this round → "Design doc first."** This note. No code yet.

Everything below follows from those three.

## The architecture already has the shape we need

Lattice's colour model is a **token band selected by a mode**:

- The screen model swaps a **light** and a **dark** band through CSS
  `color-scheme` + `light-dark(L, D)` (`themes/indaco.css:94`). Author flips
  whole-deck dark via `style: ":root{color-scheme:dark}"`.
- `section.dark` (in `lattice.css`) remaps the *main* tokens to a `--dark-*`
  band (`themes/indaco.css:170`) so the same layout structure reskins for a
  dark canvas — cover/divider/closing.

**A print band is the same move on a third axis.** Each theme declares a
`--print-*` band; a `print` mode remaps the main tokens to it, exactly as
`section.dark` remaps to `--dark-*`. Nothing about the layouts changes — they
are palette-blind by contract (`CLAUDE.md`), so they inherit the print band for
free. This is why "dedicated print theme mode" is cheap to express and
consistent with the engine.

### Why NOT plain `@media print`

The obvious-but-wrong move is `@media print { :root { --bg:#fff; … } }`.
It is too blunt: **our colour PDF export renders *through* the print path**
(puppeteer prints to PDF), so a `@media print` token remap would also strip the
colour out of the boardroom colour PDF we want to keep. The print band must be
an **explicit opt-in** (export option / front-matter `mode: print`), decoupled
from the raw `@media print` trigger, so the two deliverables stay distinct:

| Deliverable | Trigger | Tokens | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Colour PDF** (screen/projector/email) | default export | full light/dark palette | slide-px landscape, full-bleed |
| **Print handout** (paper, B&W-safe) | explicit `mode: print` | the `--print-*` band | paper-size landscape, scale-to-fit + safe margin |

`@media print and (monochrome)` stays as an *enhancement* layer only — Chromium
reports `(monochrome)` unreliably at print time (often color even for a B&W
printer, often 0 in preview), so it can sharpen the band when detected but must
never be the sole trigger.

## The print band — what "B&W-safe" actually requires

De-hueing destroys hue-only distinction, so the print band must carry meaning
on channels that survive grayscale:

- **Ink:** near-pure black body/heading on white; no light-gray body text
  (cheap printers crush it).
- **Every fill gets a stroke.** Adjacent fills that merge in gray must be
  separated by a defined border — promote `--border` to a real ink rule in the
  print band, applied to cards, table cells, chart bars, diagram nodes.
- **Category ramps collapse to lightness + pattern, not hue.** `--cat-*` /
  `--chart-*` / `--diagram-band-*` must map onto a small set distinguishable by
  **stepped lightness and/or SVG pattern fills** (hatch/dot/cross), plus their
  text labels. This is the genuinely hard part — see Open Questions.
- **Signals keep their semantics by shape, not just colour.** `--pass/--warn/--fail`
  lose red/green/amber in gray; lean on the existing glyph/label, and give each
  a distinct lightness + border so a printed RAG status is still legible.
- **Backgrounds:** bookend slides (cover/divider/closing) that are dark
  full-bleed on screen become ink-on-white framed panels in print — a dark
  flood wastes toner and prints as a muddy rectangle.

**Contrast guarantee extends to the band.** `test/unit/contrast.test.js`
already asserts every text-bearing token clears WCAG AA against its surface
(`themes/indaco.css:39`). The print band gets the same assertion against
**white**, so "B&W-safe" is a *gated* claim, not a hope.

## Orientation — yes, we can "tell the printer," two honest mechanisms

**Q: "Can we actually tell the printer how to print — prefilled orientation?"**
Yes. Two levers, depending on surface:

1. **The downloaded PDF tells the printer by its geometry.** Orientation is
   intrinsic to the page MediaBox (landscape = width > height). A landscape PDF
   opens landscape and prints landscape by default — *no dialog roulette*. Add
   `/ViewerPreferences << /PrintScaling /None >>` so viewers don't "fit to
   page"-shrink it. This is the strong path and it's why **paper-first wants a
   real downloaded PDF**, not `window.print()`. The jsPDF export
   (`drawing-board-export.js`, the image-PDF path) already lets us set
   `orientation: 'landscape'` explicitly.

2. **`window.print()` can prefill the dialog.** Switch the paper-print
   stylesheet from `@page { size: <px> <px> }` (a weird custom paper that
   Chromium scales badly onto A4/Letter) to the **keyword form**
   `@page { size: A4 landscape }` (or `letter landscape`). That *pre-selects
   landscape* in Chromium's dialog, and `margin: 0` removes the default
   header/footer. We cannot delete the dialog or force the printer's own
   driver, but we can make every default correct on arrival.

### The paper-fit crux (the real cost of "paper-first")

Our canvas is 16:9 (1280×720, ratio ≈ 1.778). **A4 landscape ≈ 1.414, Letter
landscape ≈ 1.294 — both *narrower* than 16:9.** So a 16:9 slide on A4/Letter
landscape *must* either letterbox (white bands top & bottom, scaled to width)
or crop. The honest defaults:

- **Scale-to-fit-width, centered, with a small safe margin (~8–10mm)** and
  accept top/bottom whitespace. Predictable, never crops content.
- **Offer 4:3 handout authoring.** The existing `standard 960×720` size (4:3 ≈
  1.333) fits Letter landscape almost exactly — a deck authored or re-sized to
  4:3 prints edge-to-edge. Worth surfacing as the "designed for paper" size.

A safe margin also dodges the unprintable-edge clipping every physical printer
has (full-bleed `margin:0` loses ~3–5mm at the paper edge on real hardware).

## The two builds that follow

**Build A — fix the web Print path (small, ships the reported wound).**
In `deck-preview.js:188`, swap the px `@page` for `@page { size: <paper>
landscape; margin: <safe> }`, scale the slide to fit width centered, keep the
fidelity caveat at the export action. Turns "ugly as sin" into "correct
defaults." ~half a day, no engine change.

**Build B — the dedicated print band + paper-PDF export (the substantive
piece).**
1. Add a `--print-*` band to each theme (`themes/*.css`), mirroring the
   `--dark-*` band's structure.
2. Add a `print` mode that remaps main tokens to `--print-*` — a `section`-level
   rule in `lattice.css` (sibling to `section.dark`) gated by an explicit
   trigger (front-matter `mode: print` and/or an export option), **not**
   `@media print`.
3. Resolve the category-ramp → lightness+pattern mapping (SVG pattern fills for
   chart/diagram; stepped grays + borders for cards/tables).
4. Extend `test/unit/contrast.test.js` to assert the print band vs white.
5. A **"Print handout (B&W-safe, landscape)"** export that produces a downloaded
   PDF (paper-size landscape MediaBox + `/PrintScaling /None`) in the print
   band — the artifact that "survives the trip," no dialog.
6. Per-feature demo deck `examples/<slug>.md` + committed PDF, rendered in both
   the colour and the print band, for owner sign-off (the export-change STOP
   rule in `CLAUDE.md` applies — print output is exported content).

## Resolved decisions (2026-06-14)

The open questions were put to the owner and answered. The design is now
fixed on these points:

- **Category ramp in grayscale → borders + stepped grays + SVG pattern fills.**
  Stepped lightness alone tops out at ~4–5 reliably-distinct grays on cheap
  printers, so the print band gives every fill a distinct gray **and** a black
  border, **and** chart/diagram *series* get SVG pattern fills (hatch / dot /
  cross) so distinction survives past five categories. This is the costlier
  option — it touches the chart/diagram renderers, not only tokens — and is
  accepted deliberately as the quality bar for B&W. Cards/tables lean on grays +
  borders; series-bearing components add patterns.
- **Paper fit → scale-to-fit-the-printable-area and center, paper-blind.**
  The fit *mechanism* doesn't depend on paper: scale the slide to the printable
  area, center it, hold a small safe margin (~8–10mm, also dodging the
  unprintable-edge clip every physical printer has). White letterbox bands
  simply shrink as the sheet's ratio approaches the slide's. Never crops.
- **Downloaded-PDF paper size → auto-pick the closest-fit standard sheet.**
  The baked MediaBox is chosen to best fit the deck's aspect: **16:9 → US Legal**
  (1.65, the closest standard sheet to 1.78 — only ~7% letterbox vs 27% on
  Letter), **4:3 → Letter/A4** (by locale). No paper picker in v1 — the engine
  picks the sheet that wastes the least page; the `window.print()` path still
  honours whatever the user selects in the dialog (scale-to-fit makes any
  choice correct).
- **Slide-aspect → guidance only, 16:9 stays the default.** No forced re-size.
  Surface a hint at the print-export action ("handouts print fullest on Legal;
  author at 4:3 to fill Letter/A4") so authors can opt into a paper-friendly
  aspect without us reflowing their composition.
- **Mode trigger → export option *and* front-matter `mode: print`.** The
  export-time option is the must-have (printing is a render choice, not a deck
  property); front-matter `mode: print` is the optional convenience for authors
  who always print B&W.
- **CLI parity → engine `--print` flag, CLI *and* web.** The print band is an
  engine render option (a `--print` flag), reachable from both the `lattice` CLI
  and the Drawing Board, honouring the shared-kernel rule (`CLAUDE.md` HARD
  RULE #1) — the mode lives in the engine, not the UI.

### Paper-fit reference

Page-fill of a slide scaled to fit each landscape sheet (ratio = long ÷ short):

| Paper | Ratio | 16:9 fill | 4:3 fill |
|---|---|---|---|
| US Letter | 1.29 | 73% | **97%** |
| A4 | 1.41 | 80% | 94% |
| **US Legal** | **1.65** | **93%** | 80% |
| Tabloid/Ledger | 1.55 | 87% | 86% |
| *slide* | 1.78 (16:9) · 1.33 (4:3) | — | — |

### Still out of scope

- **Speaker-notes handout** (slide + notes per page) — the classic boardroom
  leave-behind and a natural sibling, but a separate feature; not folded in
  here.

## Recommendation

Ship **Build A now** (the literal reported wound, low-risk: swap the web Print
stylesheet to scale-to-fit-center + a landscape paper default, kill the dialog
header/footer). Then **Build B** as the real deliverable, sequenced:
print band + contrast gate (assert vs white) → auto-paper-fit PDF export
(closest-fit MediaBox + `/PrintScaling /None`) → category-ramp SVG pattern
work for chart/diagram → engine `--print` flag for CLI parity → demo deck
rendered in colour *and* the print band for owner sign-off (the export-change
STOP rule applies).
