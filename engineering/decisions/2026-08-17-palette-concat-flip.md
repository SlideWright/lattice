summary: >
  #1527 shipped. `lattice-emulator.js:782` now builds the export bundle as `layoutCSS +
  paletteCSS` instead of `paletteCSS + layoutCSS`, so the base loads FIRST and a palette's own
  `:root` wins on equal specificity — the order every theme declares with its opening `@import
  'lattice'`, the order `lib/engine/css.js` composeCss has always used, and the order the two
  Mermaid var readers in this same file already used. The export was the odd one out of four
  sites. Sweep re-run as the sign-off asked: a nine-slide deck from live gallery slides, 32
  themes x both color-modes x before and after = 1,152 renders compared by SHA-256. 64 of 64
  theme-modes change at least one slide; 196 of 576 changed slide instances; 36 DISTINCT states
  (28 duplicate pairs, computed from the renders rather than from filenames) and all 36 change;
  96 distinct changed renderings. Against the 2026-08-11 sign-off's 202/99 the delta is the
  corpus moving underneath it — 925 disputed declarations across 37 tokens today against its 932
  across 36 — plus a deck whose exact slide instances that note never recorded. THE THING NO
  EARLIER PASS HAD: `check-slide-contrast` over all 9,600 rendered text runs on both sides. ZERO
  new sub-AA runs, two fixed (concrete's kanban "Done" label, 3.25:1). The ramp claims #1724
  predicted all land, measured in Chromium across 19 palettes x 2 canvases: sub-3:1 tiers 3 -> 0,
  strict monotonicity 25/38 -> 38/38, the 12 tie-collapsed encodings -> 0, tightest adjacent step
  0.000 -> 0.096 OKLab, and mustard's light weight-2 word 2.86 -> 3.41:1 — the one deck-visible
  defect #1697 could not close. TWO PREMISES IN THE BRIEF ARE WRONG AND ARE CORRECTED HERE:
  `composed-contrast`'s two arms do NOT collapse (both are built by `mergedVars` from the same
  two files; the tool never read the emulator, so its output is byte-identical before and after
  and KNOWN_SUB_THRESHOLD does not move), and the a11y dark-mode status grays are not a
  regression to repair — #1681 already gave them curated dark arms, which now render at
  5.88-13.12:1 where the base's hue-coded trio used to leak in and mean nothing to an achromat.
  NOT closed, and it is the owner's call: all 355 committed PDFs are now stale, NO gate says so
  (golden-diff compares this PR's committed goldens and this PR commits none; build:galleries
  --check does exit 1 on 122 stale gallery PDFs but lefthook.yml records that it runs in no
  workflow, no hook and no build step), and the cost lands on other people — the pre-commit
  build-staged-pdfs hook regenerates a touched deck's PDF, so the next deck PR carries this
  change's color delta fused into its own diff. Regenerating here is not free either: a rebuild
  of the UNCHANGED tree already differs on 6 of 6 sampled decks, so the pass would commit
  environmental rasterization drift alongside the real change. Also unmeasured: the eight
  --diagram-* fills (non-text, so the 9,600-run gate cannot see them), and the fact that
  base-wins used to give the export an engine-level AA floor for any consumer's own theme,
  which this removes.

# The concat flip

**2026-08-17 · branch `claude/seq-ramp-export-flip-vera8g` · #1527**

**Area:** `lattice-emulator.js`, `tools/composed-contrast.js`,
`tools/check-ownership.js`, `lib/base/base.tokens.css`, three palette tests

Two notes precede this one and neither shipped the change:
`2026-08-10-palette-concat-order.md` measured the mechanism and stopped at the
QUALITY BAR gate; `2026-08-11-palette-concat-signoff.md` produced the sign-off
package and ended with *"Then flip `lattice-emulator.js:691`, with the sweep
re-run as the proof."* This is that step. The line had drifted to **:782** before
this change, and sits at **:816** after it — the comment above it is longer than
the statement.

## The change

```js
- const css = paletteCSS + '\n' + layoutCSS;   // base last  → base wins
+ const css = layoutCSS + '\n' + paletteCSS;   // base first → palette wins
```

One line, one consumer (`${css}` in the document shell). Everything else in this
change is comments that described the old world, and the deliberate decision
about what to do with a tool that modeled both orders.

## What the sweep says

A nine-slide deck built from live `test/integration/baseline-decks/gallery.md`
slides — `divider`, `code`, `roadmap`, `list takeaway`, `gantt`, `kanban`,
`piechart`, `checklist`, `closing accent` — rendered PNG-per-slide across all 32
selectable themes in both `color-mode:`s, before and after. 1,152 renders,
compared by SHA-256. `--no-split` throughout, on both sides, so page N stays
slide N and a pagination difference cannot masquerade as a color one.

| | |
|---|---|
| theme-modes in the grid | **64** |
| …with at least one changed slide | **64 of 64** |
| changed slide instances | **196 of 576** |
| **DISTINCT** states in that grid | **36** |
| …with at least one changed slide | **36 of 36** |
| **DISTINCT** changed renderings | **96** |

**Distinctness is computed from the renders, not from the filenames**, which is a
small methodological upgrade on the sign-off. Two theme-modes are the same state
when their entire before-fingerprint matches; 28 such pairs exist, and they are
not all `-dark` wrappers. Thirteen `-dark` files × 2 modes account for 26 of
them; the other two are `a11y-deuteranopia` and `a11y-protanopia`, which render
**byte-identically on this deck** in both modes. (That is a fact about this deck,
not about those palettes — they declare the same status trio and this deck paints
nothing that separates them.) So the honest corpus is 36 states, and the earlier
note's "16 of the 32 theme files are `-dark` wrappers" is off: there are 13.

By slide:

| slide | theme-modes changed |
|---|---|
| `code` (the twelve `--hljs-*`) | 64 |
| `checklist` (`--pass`/`--warn`/`--fail`) | 64 |
| `gantt` (`--pass`, not `--diagram-*` — see below) | 28 |
| `kanban` (`--pass`) | 28 |
| `divider` | 4 |
| `closing accent` | 4 |
| `list takeaway` | 2 |
| `piechart` | 2 |
| `roadmap` | 0 |

Worst is `cuoio` in dark mode at 8 of 9; mildest is `onyx` at 2 of 9. **No theme
is unaffected in either mode.**

**The `gantt` and `kanban` rows are NOT the `--diagram-*` family, and an earlier
draft of this table said they were.** Those eight state tokens have **zero
`var()` consumers** in the engine's CSS: their only reader is
`lib/core/mermaid-theme-map.js`, fed by `PALETTE_VARS`, which
`lattice-emulator.js` has always built as `layoutCSS + '\n' + paletteCSS` — the
flipped order, on `origin/main` too. So the baked Mermaid SVG is byte-identical
across this change and those eight tokens move no pixel anywhere. **Eight of the
37 tokens, and 256 of the 925 declarations, are a paper change.** The gantt on
this deck is the native SVG component, and what moves it is `--pass`: concrete's
bar goes `rgb(45,106,63)` (the base's `#2D6A3F`) to `rgb(33,79,38)` (concrete's
own `#214F26`). Found by a red-team pass asking who actually *reads* each family
the change claims to revive — which is the question the token count does not
answer.

### The delta against the sign-off's baseline, explained rather than waved at

The 2026-08-11 package reported 202 changed instances and 99 distinct changed
renderings; this run reports 196 and 96. Two causes, and both are checkable:

1. **The corpus moved.** Re-running that note's own disputed-token harness today
   gives **925 dead declarations across 37 distinct tokens**, against its 932
   across 36. Six days of palette work (#1681's dark companions, #1704, #1719,
   #1724) changed which declarations are in dispute.
2. **The deck is not the same deck.** Neither prior note committed the nine-slide
   source or recorded which `divider` / `closing` / `takeaway` instance it took
   from a gallery that contains several of each. This run's selection is recorded
   above and the extraction is mechanical, but it cannot be identical by
   construction.

The conclusion is unchanged and does not depend on either: **36 of 36 distinct
states change, and there is no theme this is invisible on.**

## The measurement no earlier pass had

The sign-off's §6 listed four things it had not verified. This closes the largest
one for every surface that paints TEXT.

`tools/check-slide-contrast.js` reads the real rendered DOM. Run over the HTML
sidecar of every deck in the sweep, both sides — **9,600 text runs per side**:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| runs below AA | 267 | **265** |
| **new** sub-AA runs introduced by the flip | — | **0** |
| sub-AA runs fixed | — | **2** |

The two fixed are `concrete` and `concrete-dark`, light mode, the kanban "Done"
column label: `rgb(45,106,63)` on `rgb(184,184,181)`, 3.25:1, now painted from
concrete's own value and clearing the floor. That is a per-run diff, not a net
count — a net could hide a one-for-one swap, and this does not.

**What that says is that nothing CROSSED a floor, and it must not be read as
"nothing moved".** Diffing every run by identity rather than only the failures:
**1,764 runs change ratio, 1,390 of them for the worse**, and none of those 1,390
lands below 4.5 or below 3.0. The largest single drop is an `a11y-*` code span,
14.86:1 → 6.61:1. An earlier draft of this paragraph said "not one run regressed
anywhere in the corpus", which is false and contradicted the section immediately
below it; an independent checker caught it.

### What that measurement structurally cannot see

It is a **crossing count, not a magnitude**, and the difference matters here: the
2026-08-11 sign-off measured that of 684 changed `--hljs-*` / status pairs, **411
got worse**. "Zero newly below AA" is fully compatible with hundreds of runs
dropping while staying above the floor, and one of them is worth naming because it
is the largest single move a human will notice. `cuoio` declares
`--on-dark-secondary: color-mix(in srgb, white 65%, transparent)` against the
base's 76%; on its bookend canvas the body text goes **10.36:1 → 7.89:1**, sampled
from the render. That is cuoio's own curated value taking over, it is far above
the 4.5 floor, and no crossing count would ever have mentioned it.

The rest of the blind spots, from the tool's own header and its source:

- **Everything that is not text.** Rails, chips, borders, gantt bars, kanban
  fills, chart series, gradients, table rules. The gantt bars and kanban chips
  that move on 28 theme-modes are `--pass` painted as a *fill*, which no text
  check reaches — they were looked at on contact sheets, which is not the same
  claim.
- **Distinguishability.** Two categories collapsing onto one color is invisible to
  a background-contrast check; every tier can clear AA while the encoding dies.
  Ties are measured for the four `word-cloud` ramp stops and nowhere else.
- **Semantics.** A `--pass` that paints amber and a `--warn` that paints green
  swap at identical ratios and score identically.
- **Raster and gradient backdrops**, where the tool measures the wrong surface by
  construction and says so.
- **Runs whose ink goes fully transparent** are skipped, not failed.
- **The exempt tier**, keyed on the resolved composited value of `--text-muted` /
  `--border`: a newly-failing run that lands on one of those is bucketed exempt.

### And the gate that IS blocking covers one palette

`test/integration/invariants/slide-contrast.test.js` renders the **whole**
`gallery.md` and `gallery-jargon.md` through the flipped export path and holds
exact per-surface exemption counts — far wider component coverage than nine
slides, and it is green. But its corpus is `indaco` and `indaco-dark` only, and
indaco carries **17 of the 37** disputed tokens — the **lightest** in the set
(carta is next at 18). `cuoio`, the heaviest at 34, is covered by the nine-slide
sweep alone.

## The ramp claims #1724 made, measured

`2026-08-17-canvas-relative-sequential-ramp.md` shipped the poles in the base and
the anchors in the palettes, and predicted exactly what the flip would turn on.
Measured in real Chromium over the 19 distinct palettes × 2 canvases (38
combinations), on the four stops `word-cloud spectrum` paints:

| | export before | export after |
|---|---|---|
| tiers below their 3:1 bar | 3 | **0** |
| combinations carrying one | 2 / 38 | **0 / 38** |
| strictly monotonic encodings | 25 / 38 | **38 / 38** |
| combinations with a TIE (two tiers one color) | 12 | **0** |
| tightest adjacent step (OKLab) | 0.000 | **0.096** |
| worst tier vs canvas | 1.13:1 | **3.17:1** |

Four of those "before" figures — tiers 3, combinations 2/38, strict monotonicity
25/38, ties 12 — reproduce #1697's published export-path table **exactly**. The
other two reproduce figures that note states outside that table: the 1.13:1 worst
tier appears in its prose, and 0.000 is this run's own measurement of a step the
note only tabulates for the engine arm. That is what gives the "after" column its
weight — the harness was validated against a measurement written by someone else
before it was used to make a claim.

The 12 ties were `onyx` and the five `a11y-*` palettes in both modes, where the
base's `var(--accent)` anchor is pure black or white and weights 5, 4 and 3
therefore painted **one color**. They resolve to distinct tiers now.

And the single deck-visible defect #1697 could not close:

> `mustard|light`, 2.86 → 2.86 — **unchanged, and it ships**. … It is the single
> deck-visible contrast defect this change does not close, and #1527 closes it.

Measured on the render: mustard's light weight-2 word goes **`#a58a53` at 2.86:1
→ `#977d48` at 3.41:1** on the `#f5efd8` canvas. Closed.

## Two premises this change was handed, and both are wrong

Recorded because each would have produced a confident wrong edit.

### `composed-contrast`'s two arms do not collapse

The brief said the tool's cascade arms "COLLAPSE after the flip — both orders
produce the same values", and that `KNOWN_SUB_THRESHOLD` would move.

Neither happens, and the reason is one function. `mergedVars` builds **both**
arms out of `dist/lattice.css` and the palette chain — `{...base, ...palette}`
and `{...palette, ...base}` — and the file has never read `lattice-emulator.js`
at all. The flip cannot move a number in it. Verified: `node
tools/composed-contrast.js` prints `0 cascade regressions · 0 unlisted · 0
degraded · 0 stale · 0 unresolved · 123 of 1600 pairs below their bar` on both
sides of the change, and no baseline row was touched.

What *did* change is what the base-wins arm **means**. Before the flip it
described a shipping path; now it describes no render anywhere. So the live
question is whether it still earns its keep, and the answer is **yes, keep it**:
`base.tokens.css` is the reference standard an override is meant to improve on,
so "the palette's curated value is worse than the default it replaces" is a
palette-curation defect whether or not anything paints the default. That is
precisely the #1640 shape this gate was built for. Deleting the arm would delete
the only check that a re-tune moved a composed surface the wrong way. The header
now says so, and reframes the arm as a REFERENCE rather than a second cascade the
repo ships.

### The a11y dark-mode status grays are not a repair this change owes

The sign-off's §4 found `a11y-achromatopsia`'s dark checklist losing its rails and
icons under the flip, then corrected itself: the a11y palettes declare
`modes: ["light"]`, so that is a mode they say they do not have.

**The mode is reachable, and the correction's premise was wrong.** Rendering the
sweep proves it: `a11y-*` at `color-mode: dark` produces different bytes from the
same palette at `color-mode: light`, on every one of the five. The `:root:root`
pin beats the global toggle but not a per-deck mode, which lands on the section —
`a11y-base.css`'s own comment says the pin cannot reach there. So an author who
writes `color-mode: dark` with an a11y theme gets a dark canvas, and nothing warns.

**But the repair was already made, by #1681, and the flip is what makes it
visible.** `themes/a11y-*.css` carry `--pass: light-dark(#4d4d4d, #B2B2B2)` and
its siblings, with a comment saying in as many words that those arms *"are inert
until #1527 flips the order"*. They are not inert now. Scored on the real composed
surfaces, the a11y family's checklist rows land at **5.88–13.12:1** on the dark
canvas, against a 3:1 bar.

Looking at the render settles the remaining question, and it takes the opposite
reading to the sign-off's first one — but the argument has to be made on
luminance, not on hue, because luminance is exactly the channel an achromat keeps.
The base's dark status arms:

| token | dark arm | relative luminance |
|---|---|---|
| `--pass` | `#4ADE80` | 0.553 |
| `--warn` | `#F97316` | 0.325 |
| `--fail` | `#F87171` | 0.330 |

**`--warn` and `--fail` are 1.01:1 apart — amber and red were literally one gray**,
and `--pass` vs `--warn` is 1.61:1, below any distinguishability bar. So before the
flip an achromatopsia deck's dark checklist painted green and amber rails that
carried, at best, one bit. After it, the palette's curated arms
(`#B2B2B2` / `#909090` / `#D9D9D9`) give warn 0.279 < pass 0.445 < fail 0.694 —
ordered, no collapsed pair, adjacent separations 1.51:1 / 1.50:1 / 2.26:1 — plus
four distinct glyph shapes (✓ − ○ ⊘), which is what that palette leans on. Note the
best-separated pair gets slightly *worse* (1.61 → 1.51): the after wins because it
is complete and ordered, not because any pair widened. The color did not
disappear; the *pretence* of color did.

**The reachable-unsupported-mode gap is filed rather than fixed**, as #18 requires
for a pre-existing defect found off-path: **#1736**.

## The one thing the flip broke, and the fix it forced

**A red-team pass found a real, self-inflicted, HIGH-severity regression on a
canvas the sweep never touched: `section.print`.** Recorded in full because the
mechanism generalizes.

`themes/carbone.css` pins **literal** poles — `--seq-pole-low: black;
--seq-pole-high: white;` — because carbone's canvas stays graphite whatever
`color-scheme` says, and `section.light` / `.color-light` flip the scheme below
`:root`. Pre-flip the base's `light-dark(white, black)` pair won at `:root`, and a
`light-dark()` inside a custom property is **not resolved where it is declared** —
it rides along in the inherited token stream and resolves at the element that
finally uses it. The print band pins `color-scheme: light`, so the ramp came out
paper-correct. Post-flip carbone's literals win, and **a literal cannot re-resolve**.
Measured on the real print export of `word-cloud.gallery.md`, against white paper:

| tier | pre-flip | post-flip, pre-fix | after the fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| weight 5 | 19.62:1 | **1.18:1** | **20.75:1** |
| weight 4 | 6.93:1 | **1.67:1** | **15.72:1** |
| weight 2 | 1.42:1 | 5.00:1 | **6.90:1** |

`check-slide-contrast` on that deck went 2 runs below AA → **3**, the new worst
being the slide's largest word at 76px.

**Why every gate missed it.** `composed-contrast` merges only `:root` and is
order-blind by construction, so it cannot see a `section.print` band at all. The
render sweep is nine slides with no `word-cloud` and no print mode. And the print
band's own three-line pole pin was **already inert on the export path** — its
comment said so — but that inertness had never mattered, because the base's
`light-dark()` poles resolved late and landed right *by luck rather than by the pin*.

**The fix is in the base, not in carbone** (HARD RULE #1: the print band is shared
kernel). A custom property is substituted at the element that DECLARES it, so
`--seq-900`, declared at `:root`, bakes `:root`'s anchor and `:root`'s poles;
re-pinning the poles on a descendant band changes nothing unless the **stops** are
re-declared where the new inputs live. `base.modifiers.css`'s print band now
re-declares all nine. That removes the regression and clears two failures that
were there before it: the band's own `--seq-500: var(--print-seq-500)` grayscale
anchor had never reached the derived stops on the export path either, which is why
weight 2 sat at 1.42:1 on paper before any of this. Re-checked across
`carbone onyx concrete mustard indaco cuoio a11y-achromatopsia magnolia` in print:
**0 of 210 runs below AA on every one.**

The transferable part: **`light-dark()` in a custom property is a late-resolving
token, and a literal is not.** A palette that replaces one with the other changes
where in the tree the value is decided, not just what it is — and every band that
remaps the inputs of a derived token has to re-derive the token, or its remap is
decoration.

## What is not verified, and one thing that is now worse

- **All 355 committed PDFs are stale, no gate will say so, and the cost compounds
  onto other people.** This is the sharpest open question in the change and it is
  the owner's, so it is set out in full.

  *Nothing catches it — including the one script that appeared to.*
  `checkCommittedPdfs` audits ownership, not freshness. The CI visual regression
  gate is retired (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, Skia rasterization flake).
  `golden-diff` diffs **this PR's committed goldens** against the base branch, and
  this PR commits none — so the PR that changes 36 of 36 distinct theme-modes will
  post *"nothing changed"*. `build:galleries --check` detected it **only while the
  tree was dirty**: it compares `git status --porcelain` against HEAD, so the
  moment the flip was committed it went back to exit 0 and *"122 gallery PDFs: no
  render input changed since HEAD"*. `tools/lib/render-inputs.js` documents exactly
  that hole — *"It cannot see a change that was committed WITHOUT rebuilding the
  PDFs"*. And `lefthook.yml` says the script *"is invoked by no workflow, no hook
  and no build step"* anyway. In the shipped state the detection does not exist,
  on-demand or otherwise. (An earlier draft of this note cited that exit-1 as the
  one thing that would catch it; an independent checker re-ran it post-commit and
  it passed.)

  *How the cost lands.* The pre-commit hook `tools/build-staged-pdfs.js`
  regenerates the PDF for any deck markdown in a commit. So the next person to
  touch any deck gets their intended change **fused** with this flip's color
  delta for that deck, and `golden-diff` attributes all of it to them. That
  repeats, deck by deck, until all 355 are drained. The failure mode is not "the
  colors are wrong"; it is "nobody can tell what a deck PR changed any more".

  *Why they are not regenerated here.* Rebuilding six sampled decks from the
  **unchanged** tree at `44af457` already produces different bytes in **6 of 6**
  cases (`gallery-jargon`, `a11y`, `build`, `claim`, `chart-legends`,
  `accent-finishes`; `seq-ramp-canvas-aware` reproduces byte-identically, and it
  was regenerated in this container image on #1724). A regeneration pass here
  commits environmental font-rasterization drift alongside the real change and the
  diff cannot separate them.

  *The two honest options, both the owner's to pick.* Regenerate all 355 in one
  dedicated commit that says in its message that it includes environmental
  rasterization drift — the precedent is `2026-08-11-palette-concat-signoff.md`
  §7e, which made exactly that call for `kit/Sample-Deck.pdf` and named it an
  accepted cost; absorbing the drift once deliberately beats absorbing it 355
  times unattributed. Or hold the flip until a freshness gate exists so the
  staleness is loud. **#1623** tracks that gate.
- **A fifth site already agreed with the flip, and it is a check on the reasoning.**
  `kit/Sample-Deck.pdf` is produced by real `marp-cli` against `dist/marp-kit`
  (`tools/build-marp-kit.js`), and marp-cli resolves `@import 'lattice'` natively —
  so the kit has always rendered palette-wins. It is unaffected by this change,
  which is the point: the order this line now uses is the one an off-the-shelf CSS
  engine already produced from the same files.
- **The export path used to carry an engine-level floor, and this removes it.**
  Under base-wins the base's `--hljs-comment` / `--hljs-literal` were solved against
  its own panel *and all 15 distinct `--code-bg` values in the corpus*
  (`2026-08-11` §7d), so no theme could produce a sub-AA exported code panel
  whatever its author wrote. Post-flip the only thing between an arbitrary palette
  and a sub-AA PDF is `checkHljsContrast`, which scans `themes/` — this repo's own
  palettes. Studio-generated themes are covered (`lib/theme/derive.js` was raised to
  4.5). A consumer's hand-authored theme is not, and now nothing catches it. That
  door is closed for later, not by this change.
- **PPTX and the exported HTML player are covered structurally, not swept.** The
  sign-off called them UNVERIFIED. They are not a separate path: `lattice-emulator.js`
  navigates the browser to the same `outHtml` that embeds `${css}`, and the PNG
  buffers that navigation produces are what `writePptx` packs and what the `.png`
  output writes; the `.html` deliverable is that same shell. The sweep's PNGs are
  not byte-identical to the PPTX's images — `OMIT_BG` differs between the two arms,
  so the `.png` path renders transparent where `.pptx` stays opaque — so this is a
  same-code-path argument, not the same artifact. No sweep drove a `.pptx` or a
  player end-to-end.
- **The sweep harness and its deck are committed** (`tools/sweep-concat-order/`),
  which is the defect this note criticized the two prior passes for: neither
  recorded which gallery slide instances its deck used, so neither number can be
  re-derived. This one can.
- **Nine slides, not the whole gallery.** Unchanged from the sign-off. A component
  reading a dead token that this deck does not paint would not appear here. The
  token-level measurement (925 declarations, 37 tokens) is exhaustive; the render
  sweep is not exhaustive over components.
- **Non-text surfaces are covered by `composed-contrast`'s catalog, not by a
  render.** `check-slide-contrast` sees text runs. Rails, chips, bars and diagram
  fills are scored by the composed-surface catalog, which is green — but that
  catalog is a curated list of surfaces, not everything the engine paints.
- **The status trio's real reference surface** stays unmeasured per component; the
  sign-off's §4 showed `--bg` is the wrong pair for at least the a11y icon use.
  Unchanged by this note.
