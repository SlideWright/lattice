# Form — implementing the composition model in code

**Status:** in progress 2026-06-15. Implements the canonical model in
`design/forms.md` (Form = Frame + Cell + Tile) as actual engine + CSS, fixing
the open chrome-over-content defect at its root and retiring the *islands*
vocabulary in code. `design/forms.md` owns the **model**; this note owns the
**execution** (per forms.md §11, "Doc ownership") and supersedes the forward
plan in `2026-06-11-islands.md` §8 and the open follow-ons in
`2026-06-13-islands-sketch-density-collisions.md`.

This is the engineering ADR `design/forms.md` §5/§11 defer the field-level
schema and execution plan to.

---

## 1. Why now — the model was real, the code was not

The Form vocabulary was ratified (`design/forms.md`, 2026-06-14) but lived
**only in docs**: no code used Frame/Cell/Tile, no `lib/forms/` manifest
existed, and the shipped `islands` feature was the incremental approximation —
*berths done with magic-number padding + a hard `overflow:hidden` clip*. It
"worked" but carried critical design flaws that are downstream of the model not
being real: there is no bounded content **Cell**, so chrome reservation is a
fixed guess and a chart has no concrete box to size into (the §6 LSP violation
in the flesh).

This ADR makes the model real in code, at the altitude the canonical doc locks:
**B-now (Cell-as-berth overlay) → A-later (section-as-grid)**.

## 2. Verified ground truth (rendered, not assumed)

Rendered `examples/` content under the Form toggle at HD via the owned engine
(`lattice-emulator.js`), 2026-06-15. The docs and prior notes **disagreed** on
the chart state; the render settles it:

- **Chart collapse was REAL and severe (now FIXED — see `2026-06-15-form-chart-clip.md`).**
  A `piechart donut` under the Form collapsed from a full ring to a ~40px
  thumbnail with an unreadable dot-legend. The M1 resolution note in
  `2026-06-13-islands-sketch-density-collisions.md` claims this was fixed; it
  was **not** at that point — that claim is stale and is corrected here. Root
  cause: the chart's height chain (`section` flex → `.chart-body` flex:1 →
  `.piechart-figure` flex:1 `container-type:size` → svg `height:100cqh`)
  collapses in PRINT media when the masthead `padding-top` reservation squeezes
  the flex column — a `flex:1` figure whose sole child is a replaced `<svg>`
  won't grow, so the `cqh`/`%` basis resolves toward 0. The robust fix sizes the
  SVG off the **chart-body's content box** (see §5 and the dedicated decision
  doc); sizing against the section with a `cqi` height — the first attempt —
  produced the opposite failure (overflow → `overflow:hidden` clip).
- **Footer ↔ progress-rail collision is REAL.** The left-aligned `footer:` text
  runs straight through the centred "SECTION 0n · …" progress label, because
  the two are independent absolutely-positioned elements sharing one row with
  no reserved horizontal budget (only a `max-width:24cqi` truncation hack on
  the rail).
- **Bottom reserve is a magic number.** `padding-bottom: 8.75cqi` is unrelated
  to the real footer/rail height.

(Rendered evidence retained in `.scratch/form-baseline/` on the 14-day scratch
lifecycle; reproduced by the committed gallery.)

## 3. The architecture — model → code

> **A Frame divides a box into Cells; each Cell holds a Tile — or a Frame.**

Mapped onto the existing three-band structure (the root chrome Frame):

| Model noun | Code realization |
|---|---|
| **Root Frame** | `section.form` — carries the chrome Frame (masthead · stage · footer bands). Stays `display:flex` (see §4). |
| **Masthead Cell** | `.cell-masthead` — an **in-flow, content-height band** (the hairline sits directly under the title — no dead space; the band grows for a two-line title), an internal sub-Frame splitting into `.masthead-lede` (kicker + title Tiles) and `.masthead-bay` (meta · logo · status Tiles). |
| **Stage Cell** | the section's **deterministic content region** below the in-flow masthead and above the absolute footer band. *Not a wrapper element* (see §4) — its box is the fixed-size slide minus the masthead band and the reserved footer. (The masthead is in-flow rather than a fixed-height absolute reserve because charts size against their own `.chart-body`, not the section's cqh, so the band no longer needs to shrink the section's cqh — which is what previously forced a fixed-height reserved band and left dead space under short titles.) |
| **Footer Cell** | a three-zone coordinate contract (`footer-left` · `progress-centre` · `pagination-right`) with reserved, non-overlapping horizontal budgets. Pagination is a `::after` pseudo-element, so the footer Cell is a **token contract**, not a DOM grid. |
| **Tiles** | `.tile-meta`, `.tile-progress`, `.tile-watermark`, plus the chrome `<footer>`/`::after`/`<header>` and the component DOM (the content Tile). |
| **z-planes** | `isolation` / `z-index` stacking contexts (already in use). **Distinct from CSS `@layer`** (inert; blocked by the `!important` competition — `engineering/cascade.md`, issues #283/#284). The Form does **not** touch `@layer`. |

## 4. The pivotal constraint — 242 child selectors → B-now, not A-now

The principled end-state (`design/forms.md` §10 "A — section-as-grid") makes the
stage Cell a real element. We **cannot** do that now: component CSS contains
**242 `section.X > …` direct-child selectors** (e.g. `section.decision > ul >
li`). Wrapping the body in a `.cell-stage` element — or any grid that needs a
stage wrapper for multi-child bodies — breaks every one of them. `display:
contents` does not help: selectors match the DOM tree, not the box tree.

That migration (rewriting 242 selectors + every component's flex assumption) is
exactly the "A-later" the canonical doc defers. So this ADR implements **B-now
faithfully**: the stage Cell is the section's already-deterministic content
region (fixed slide − the in-flow masthead − the reserved footer), the
chart-collapse is fixed at its cqh-chain root, and the footer Cell is a token
contract. The §6 contract ("every Cell resolves to a deterministic px box") is
**satisfied** — the slide is fixed-size and each chrome Cell takes a determinate
band (the masthead its content height, the footer its reserve), so the stage box is
deterministic without an element.

**A-later is now de-risked and quantified:** the only remaining work to reach
section-as-grid is the 242-selector migration (+ flex→grid component audit),
tracked as the staged north star. It pairs with `@layer` activation and stays
optional.

## 5. Flaw → root-cause fix

| Flaw | Fix |
|---|---|
| Chart collapse / clip | Under `section.form`, the SVG sizes off the **`.chart-body` content box** (`.chart-body{container-type:size}`, figure `display:contents`, svg `height:100cqh`). The chart-body fills the stage reliably via flex even in print; its cqh basis = fill height − own padding = the real available figure area, tracking every chrome combo (0/1/2-line subtitle ± caption). A first attempt sized against the **section** with a `cqi` height — that was wrong twice over: `cqi` is a WIDTH unit (~589px at HD), far taller than the squeezed band, so the SVG overflowed and `.chart-body{overflow:hidden}` CLIPPED the ring + legend to a fragment, and the `max-height:100cqh` guard (read against the section) never engaged. The print-media gotchas that forced this: a `flex:1` figure whose sole child is a replaced `<svg>` will NOT grow to fill the chart-body, and `cqh`/`%`/abs-inset read against that figure collapse — only the chart-body's own content-box cqh is trustworthy. See `2026-06-15-form-chart-clip.md`. |
| Footer ↔ rail collision | `.cell-footer` reserves three non-overlapping horizontal zones via shared tokens; footer-left yields the centre when a rail is present (`has-progress`). The truncation hack is removed. |
| Bottom overrun | The stage's bottom reserve derives from the **real** footer Cell height token, not the `8.75cqi` guess. |
| Top-left/board feel | Per-Cell **`fill`** discipline (`start` · `center` · `optical-center` · `anchor`) — the difference between "grid of boxes" and a board deck. |

## 6. First-class Form — the `lib/forms/` manifest

The model becomes a **single source of truth the engine reads**, generated
beside `dist/docs/components.json` (reusing the component manifest
infrastructure — HARD RULE 15):

```
lib/forms/
  frame/<frame>/<frame>.manifest.json   # slicers (selectable structural "themes")
  tile/<tile>/<tile>.manifest.json      # fillers (the registry rows)
  schema/cell.schema.json               # the shared slot definition
```

**What the manifest drives TODAY (load-bearing):** the engine derives
`FORM_TOGGLE_SKIP` from the frame manifests (`exemptFromChrome:true`), so adding
a chrome-exempt sovereign Frame is a folder, not a code edit — proven
byte-identical to the prior hardcoded set. It also validates the catalog
(schema + `accepts`/`fits` referential integrity) and generates
`dist/docs/forms.json`.

**What it does NOT drive yet (honest scope):** the `--frame-*`/`--cell-*`
geometry, the masthead/stage/footer grid, the `fill-*` classes, and the Tile
injectors (`masthead-lift`, meta/progress/watermark) are still hand-coded in
`base.variants.css` and the kernels. The manifest's per-Cell
`geometry`/`fill`/`accepts`/`z` are catalog data, not yet the CSS/injector
source. So the full OCP win — "adding a Tile is a folder, not edits to three
kernels" (`design/forms.md` §11) — is **set up, not delivered**: the catalog and
the skip-derivation ship; manifest-driven grid + injectors are **staged**
alongside A-later (§8). The vocabulary, schema, and the one load-bearing
consumer are the foundation that makes the rest mechanical.

### 6.1 Self-containment PoC — the `watermark` Tile (issue #356)

The honest gap above ("the Tile injectors are hand-coded in `base.variants.css`
and the kernels") has a second cost beyond not-yet-manifest-driven: each Tile's
logic is **hand-copied across the render paths** — the HTML-string injector in
`lib/integrations/marp/plugins.js` AND the DOM mirror in
`lib/runtime/form-dom.js` — and its CSS lives far away in `base.variants.css`.
That is exactly the duplication our **components** don't have: a component owns
its CSS + kernel + manifest + gallery in one folder, and the kernel exposes both
adapters (`applyToHtml`/`applyToDom`) so the three paths share ONE implementation.

The `watermark` Tile is the **proof-of-concept** that a Form Tile can be just as
self-contained. It now owns one folder:

```
lib/forms/tile/watermark/
  watermark.manifest.json    # the registry row (already here)
  watermark.transform.js     # ONE kernel — applyToHtml + applyToDom
  watermark.css              # moved out of base.variants.css
```

- **One kernel, both adapters.** `applyToHtml` (the engine + BYO-marp HTML-string
  path) and `applyToDom` (the preview/runtime DOM path) live in the same file and
  share the section-number derivation. The previously-duplicated copies
  (`applyWatermarkToHtml` in `plugins.js`, `injectWatermark` in `form-dom.js`) are
  deleted; the depth-aware `<section>` walker they relied on was extracted to the
  shared `lib/core/split-sections.js` so the progress rail and the watermark
  kernel share one copy. The cross-path parity pin moved with it
  (`test/unit/forms/watermark-tile.test.js`).
- **Co-located CSS, same cascade slot.** `tools/build-css.js` globs
  `lib/forms/tile/<id>/<id>.css` into the bundle immediately after
  `base.variants.css` — the exact slot the rules held inline — so the cascade is
  unchanged and the emitted rules are byte-identical (the bundle gains only the
  source banner/comment lines). Adding/removing a Tile folder needs no edit to the
  source list.

**Honest about what this is — and isn't.** This mirrors the **file shape** of the
component kernel+adapter pattern (logic + both adapters in one folder), and that
half is real: the Tile's logic is now ONE shared implementation, not three
hand-copies, so HARD RULE 1 holds by construction. It does **not** yet mirror the
component *dispatch* half — components self-register into
`lib/transformers/registry.js` and the renderers iterate it, whereas the watermark
Tile is still wired by three direct `require` + call sites (`lib/engine/index.js`,
`marp.config.js`, `lib/runtime/index.js`), because — like the progress rail — it
runs once on the whole-deck shell, not per-section through the registry. So adding
the *next* self-contained Tile is one folder + three call-site lines, not one
folder. Collapsing that last wiring cost (a Form-Tile dispatch list the three
paths iterate) is the repeatability step for #356, alongside making the Tile
manifest-driven.

This is behaviour-preserving (the `01` ghost renders identically; full unit +
integration + `build:check` + pixel parity green) and establishes the pattern
the other Tiles (meta, progress, masthead-lift) follow when #356 migrates them.
It does **not** yet make the Tile *manifest-driven* — that remains the §6 staged
work; self-containment is the prerequisite move that makes it mechanical.

## 7. The rename (retiring island-jargon)

`islands → form` (class + toggle) · `berth → Cell` · `island → Tile` ·
`group → Frame`; `.isl-*` → `.cell-*`/`.tile-*`; `--isl-*` →
`--frame-*`/`--cell-*`; `islands:` toggle → `form: <frame>`. **Kept:**
`masthead`, `progress`, `watermark` (surviving Cell/Tile concepts, not
island-jargon). Cautions honored: `form` is a substring of `transform` (no
blind sed — only exact identifiers renamed); landed lock-step across all three
render paths (HARD RULE 1) and gated pixel-identical.

## 8. What ships here vs. staged

**Ships (this PR):** the rename to Form vocab (3 paths, pixel-identical); the
footer Cell token contract; the chart-collapse root fix; the bottom reserve
from real Cell heights; per-Cell `fill` discipline; the `lib/forms/` manifest
(engine-read catalog + generated `dist/docs/forms.json`); a
`design/forms.gallery.md` value demo + `examples/form.md` demo deck; docs sync
(`design-system.md` §2.5, CLAUDE.md row, CHANGELOG).

**Staged (documented, not in this PR).** Tracked as a single follow-up proposal,
**#356** (manifest revision + maintainability cleanups — kept as-is for now,
revised deliberately later):
- **Manifest-driven geometry + Tile injectors** (§6): make the `--frame-*` grid,
  the `fill-*` set, and the meta/progress/watermark injectors read from
  `lib/forms/` instead of being hand-coded — the full OCP win — OR trim the
  manifest to load-bearing-only. The catalog + schema + skip-derivation that ship
  here are its foundation; the keep-vs-trim decision is #356.
- **A — section-as-grid**: the 242-child-selector migration + flex→grid audit
  (§4). The B-now content Cell is its prerequisite and is now in place.
- **`@layer` activation** (#283/#284) — blocked, untouched.
- **Workbench Frame studio / AI-assisted Frame generation** (`forms.md` §7).

## 9. Gates

Three-renderer parity; per-component galleries (light + dark page-counts);
`tools/pixel-check.js` before/after on the baseline deck; **non-`form` decks
byte-identical** — the Form *behaviour* is `section.form`-scoped; the
`--isl-*`→`--frame-*` token rename does touch shared chrome rules
(`section header/footer`, `img.deck-logo`) but carries the identical literal
values, so output is unchanged (verified AE=0 on the control deck). Visual
review of the gallery at HD light + dark, with the donut verified at HD **and**
4K.
