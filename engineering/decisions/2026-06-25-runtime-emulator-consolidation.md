summary: Answers "do we maintain two engines, runtime and emulator?" — no. They are two thin shells over one shared core (lib/engine + the kernels + the registry), each an adapter for a different environment: the emulator is the Node CLI that transforms HTML strings (applyToHtml); the runtime is the browser script that mutates the marp-vscode preview DOM (applyToDom). Every transform lives once and exposes both adapters; the only genuine duplication is a small, test-pinned set of sibling functions forced by "the browser bundle can't require a Node module" (the Mermaid theme-var map, orientation math, overflow, the state-token decoder). The real wart is the NAME: "emulator" meant "emulates the HTML Marp CLI produces because we can't install marp-cli here", but Marp was retired as a render path in P4, so the file no longer emulates anything — it IS the engine's CLI (the published bin is already `lattice`). Two proposed moves, each its own PR (HARD #17): (1) rename lattice-emulator.js → the engine CLI and scrub the "emulates Marp" framing; (2) collapse the duplicated Mermaid var-map into one shared data module both resolvers consume. The behaviour siblings stay (test-pinned, environment-forced).

# Runtime + emulator — one core, two shells (consolidation review)

**Date:** 2026-06-25 · **Status:** Proposed · **Decision owner:** maintainer ·
**Touches:** `lattice-emulator.js`, `lib/runtime/index.js`, `engineering/architecture.md`

## 0. The question

> *"One [the runtime] is for including as a script tag in markdown to enable
> rendering in the Marp VS Code extension; the emulator is our command line. We
> are no longer emulating — we are the engine. So: do we need two? Are we keeping
> up two things? Do they share a central core?"* — maintainer, 2026-06-25

The instinct is right on both counts: the name is stale, and it's worth checking
whether two files means two maintenance burdens. The short answer: **they share a
central core — heavily — and are not two engines.** They are two *shells* over one
kernel, each an adapter for a different runtime environment. The genuine
duplication is small, bounded, and test-pinned. The actual wart is the **name**,
not the structure.

## 1. What each one is, today

| | `lattice-emulator.js` → `dist/lattice-emulator.js` (the `bin`) | `lib/runtime/index.js` → `dist/lattice-runtime.js` (the `<script>`) |
|---|---|---|
| Environment | Node CLI | Browser |
| Input | markdown source (a string) | live DOM marp-vscode already rendered |
| Job | parse → render → PDF / PPTX / PNG / HTML | post-process the preview DOM in place |
| Transform surface it calls | `applyToHtml` (string transforms) | `applyToDom` (mutate live nodes) |
| Published as | package `bin`/`main` (command: **`lattice`**) | a `<script src>` for the Marp preview + published HTML |

The decisive fact, from `architecture.md` and `2026-06-11-emulator-on-engine-p2.md`:
**the emulator renders markdown *through `lib/engine`*.** Its old bespoke
`parseSlide` regex parser (~620 lines) was deleted in P2 — Lattice has **one**
markdown implementation, not two. The emulator is the engine's CLI wrapper that
adds the things only a CLI does: arg/palette resolution, Mermaid pre-render
(mmdc/Puppeteer), and Puppeteer→PDF/PPTX/PNG plus the HTML sidecar.

## 2. The shared core is real and large

Both paths `require()` the *same files* for every transform that matters:

- **The engine** — `lib/engine` — canonical for every first-party render path
  (HARD RULE #1; `marp-independence.md` §"render path" table).
- **Transform kernels**, each exposing **both** adapters in one file:
  - `lib/core/*` — split-panels, below-note, bg-image, resolve-finish, … (structural primitives)
  - `lib/components/<bucket>/<name>/<name>.transform.js` — roadmap, charts, compare-code, …
  - `lib/forms/tile/*` — `meta` / `progress` / `watermark`, self-contained Tiles (#356)
- **The registry** — `lib/transformers/` — the wiring layer both consume through one interface.

So a new component or a behaviour change is authored **once**, in one kernel, and
both paths pick it up — the engine via `applyToHtml`, the runtime via `applyToDom`.
This is the architecture `2026-05-17-shared-transformer-registry.md` set out to
build, and it's holding.

## 3. What *is* genuinely duplicated — and why it's irreducible

A small, **test-guarded** set of sibling functions, every one forced by the same
hard constraint: *the browser bundle cannot `require()` a Node module*, so a few
pieces of knowledge are expressed twice — once as Node code, once as browser code:

| Duplicated surface | Emulator (Node) | Runtime (browser) | Guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mermaid theme-var mapping** | `MERMAID_VAR_MAP` (a *data* map; resolved offline by parsing palette CSS via `parsePaletteVars`/`resolveTokenExpr`) | `buildMermaidThemeVars()` (the *same* map expressed as code; resolved live via `getComputedStyle` + a probe element) | "verified byte-equivalent in the smoke test" (`architecture.md` §"Where transforms live") |
| **Orientation math** | `orientationFor`/`orientationCss` (`lib/engine/css.js`) | `injectOrientationStyle`/`stampOrientation` | `test/unit/engine/engine.test.js` pins the two against drift |
| **Overflow signal** | emulator post-render measure | runtime overflow watcher | `architecture.md` post-process table row |
| **State-token decoder** | shared kernel / engine path | `stateClassesFor` (runtime copy) | "sibling implementations … must stay in sync" comment |

This is the *irreducible* cost of having both a Node string surface and a browser
live-DOM surface. It is bounded (four items), gated, and not growing.

## 4. The actual wart: the name lies

`lattice-emulator.js`'s own header says it *"Emulates the HTML structure that Marp
CLI produces"* and *"exists only because Marp CLI cannot be installed in this build
environment."* Both statements are now **false**:

- Marp was **retired as a render path in P4** (`2026-06-12-p4-regression-gate-retire-marp.md`;
  `marp-independence.md`: *"Marp is gone as a dependency and as our render path."*).
  The owned engine is the only render path. There is nothing left to emulate.
- The published command is **already `lattice`** (`package.json` `bin`). Only the
  *file* still carries the legacy name.

So the file that the gut flagged — "we are no longer emulating, we are the engine" —
is exactly right. It is the engine's CLI front-end wearing a retired-era name.

## 5. Decision

**Keep two shells. They are not redundant — they are two adapters for two genuinely
different environments (a Node process transforming strings; a browser script
mutating live DOM). That is the correct architecture, not duplicated maintenance.**
The heavy lifting is already shared; do not try to collapse the two into one file.

Two consolidation moves are worth doing; neither changes the bytes of any exported
artifact. Per HARD RULE #17 (one feature = one branch = one PR), each ships
independently:

### Move 1 — rename the file, scrub the "emulates Marp" framing *(its own PR)*

`lattice-emulator.js` → the engine CLI (e.g. `lattice-cli.js`), and rewrite the
file header + `showHelp()` to describe what it is: the engine's command-line
renderer. Mechanical but broad — the rename touches the source file, the build
(`tools/build-emulator.js` → its output names `dist/lattice-emulator.js` /
`.min.js`), `package.json` `bin`/`main`, the parity tool
(`tools/emulator-engine-parity.mjs`), tests (`test/integration/galleries/emulator.gallery.test.js`),
and doc references. The published *command* (`lattice`) does **not** change, so
consumers are unaffected; this is an internal/source rename + an honest header.
Because it touches the published `bin` surface, it deserves a recorded rationale —
this doc — before the code.

### Move 2 — unify the Mermaid var-map duplication *(its own PR)*

The map *shape* (which Mermaid theme key ← which Lattice token) is identical in
both files; only the **resolution** differs (offline CSS parse vs `getComputedStyle`).
Extract the shape into one shared *data* module (e.g. `lib/integrations/mermaid/theme-var-map.js`)
that both consume: the emulator feeds it through `parsePaletteVars`, the runtime
feeds it through its `vc()` probe resolver. This deletes the whole
"verified byte-equivalent by smoke test" drift class — the map becomes single-source,
and the smoke test downgrades from "do two hand-kept maps still agree?" to "does the
one map still cover every key?".

### Explicitly *not* moved

The orientation / overflow / state-decoder siblings stay duplicated. They are
*behaviour*, not data — harder to share across the Node/browser boundary — and are
already pinned by tests against drift. Folding them in would add risk for little
gain; revisit only if one of them starts churning.

## 6. Why this is safe / risks

- **No exported-artifact bytes change.** Move 1 is a rename + comments; Move 2 is a
  refactor that resolves to the same Mermaid theme values. Both stay inside the
  "ordinary CSS/layout work" lane — not the export-sign-off lane — *provided* the
  emulator's golden PDFs render byte-identical. Gate each PR on the
  `tools/emulator-engine-parity.mjs` harness + the Mermaid theming smoke test +
  a rebuilt-PDF spot check.
- **Move 1's blast radius is "find every reference."** A maker-checker pass
  (HARD: a rename across `bin`/build/tests/docs is high-blast-radius) catches a
  missed reference that a green unit run wouldn't — run the checker on the diff.
- **The `dist/` artifact names** (`dist/lattice-emulator.js`) are import-by-name in
  a few places (the `bin`, the export-to-Marp bundle). If the *dist filename*
  changes, keep a thin compatibility shim or update the bundle generator in the
  same PR; if only the *source* filename changes, the dist name can stay until a
  follow-up. Decide the dist-rename scope inside Move 1's PR.

## 7. Not in scope

- Removing the runtime. It is the marp-vscode preview's only post-processor; while
  marp-vscode remains the documented fastest inner loop (CLAUDE.md), the runtime
  stays. (`2026-06-11-emulator-on-engine-p2.md` §"Not in scope" — marp-vscode is
  Scope 2, a separate, larger effort.)
- The behaviour-sibling unification (see §5, "not moved").
- LPM / manifest-driven `transformSection` (#287) — orthogonal.

## 8. Tracking

Cut as a GitHub issue decomposed into the two PRs above (Move 1 rename; Move 2
Mermaid-map unify), `area: engine`, `type: refactor`. This doc is the design of
record; the issue tracks status.
