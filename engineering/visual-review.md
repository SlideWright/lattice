# Visual review at scale — parallel agent fan-out

The QUALITY BAR (`CLAUDE.md`) says: rebuild and **actually look at it**. For a
single slide or screen, one agent is enough. A **large visual sweep** is not:
every gallery, a whole-bucket layout audit, a theme rolled across all
components, a responsive pass over many pages — too much for one agent to review
carefully in sequence. Fan it out.

This is MAKER-CHECKER (`CLAUDE.md`) applied to rendered pixels instead of a diff,
and it is the proven pattern. The 2026-06-06 layout audit reviewed all 58
components this way (`engineering/decisions/2026-06-06-layout-audit/README.md`):
11 maker agents, one per bucket (the two largest buckets each got their own),
then 11 independent checkers that re-rendered and adversarially re-scored. The
checkers overturned several maker claims.

## When to fan out

Reach for it when the surface to *look at* is large and splittable:

- all per-component / per-bucket gallery PDFs (light **and** dark),
- a layout or theme audit spanning many slides,
- a docs-site change to verify across desktop · tablet · mobile (§ below),
- a rubric-scoring pass over any large set of components or pages.

Don't fan out a one-slide tweak or a single screen — just look yourself. This
earns its latency only when parallel eyes beat one agent reading in sequence.

## The unit of parallelism — split by content, never by carving a slide

**Split by independent content unit: one agent per deck, per bucket, or per
breakpoint.** Each agent looks at *whole slides*.

**Do not tile a single slide across agents.** Alignment, balance, type
hierarchy, and dead canvas are properties of the whole slide. Give one agent the
top-left and another the bottom-right and neither can judge the composition. The
layout audit split by *bucket* — whole, independent decks — for exactly this
reason.

The one exception is **4K detail drilling**. When a single 4K slide carries more
detail than the API's 2000px-per-image limit can show, split it into regions
with `tools/rasterize-for-review.sh --region` / `--crop`, one agent per region,
to inspect type and stroke fidelity at full resolution. Always pair this with
one agent on the full-slide `--overview` render, so the composition is still
judged as a whole — regions verify detail, they cannot tell you the layout holds.

## The loop

1. **Maker pass.** Spawn N agents in one message, one per deck/bucket. Each
   rasterizes its PDFs to PNG, **views every page**, reads the source and CSS,
   and scores against the rubric
   (`engineering/decisions/2026-06-06-layout-audit/`).
2. **Checker pass.** Spawn N independent agents that re-render the same
   artifacts and adversarially verify every maker claim —
   CONFIRM / REFUTE / REVISE — catching missed issues and re-scoring. The
   checker-adjudicated scores are authoritative.
3. **Lead verification.** Re-render the highest-severity claims first-hand
   before acting. Pixels, not summaries.

Spawn the makers (then the checkers) **concurrently**: one message, multiple
`Agent` calls.

## What each agent runs (don't reinvent — these already exist)

- **PDF → images, full quality:** `tools/rasterize-for-review.sh <pdf> --overview`
  fits a whole slide under the 2000px inline limit (poppler-only, no Chromium);
  `--region` / `--crop` for detail. See the script header for all modes. `Read`
  the output PNG and it renders inline.
- **Browser-free per-slide PNG:** `npx marp <deck> --config-file marp.config.js
  --allow-local-files --images png -o .scratch/x.png` writes one `x.NNN.png` per
  slide. Needs `CHROME_PATH`; see `CLAUDE.md` § Cloud sandbox.
- **Web UI:** `tools/screenshot.js <url> <png> --width …` at the three
  breakpoints. See `engineering/development.md` § Previewing the docs site.
- **Drift:** `tools/pixel-check.js`, to catch unintended changes vs. the last
  commit.

Write all PNGs under `.scratch/` (gitignored, 14-day GC).

### Responsive sweeps — desktop · tablet · mobile

For a docs-site change, split by breakpoint: one agent per width (~1440 / ~820
/ ~390px). Each screenshots every changed route at its width, then makes the
cross-cutting "familiar across all three" call the QUALITY BAR requires. Same
maker-checker discipline, same whole-screen rule — don't split one viewport
across agents.

## Output

Fold the checker-adjudicated findings into one prioritized list and fix what's
short of excellent (QUALITY BAR). For export-affecting work, STOP and show the
human both dark and light renders for sign-off. Durable audit findings belong in
an `engineering/decisions/` note, as the layout audit did.
