/**
 * Unit: a palette never overrides one of the base's `light-dark()` PAIRS with a
 * FLAT value.
 *
 * The trap this closes (engineering/decisions/2026-08-16-flat-palette-dark-companions.md):
 * `lib/base/base.tokens.css` declares many defaults as pairs — sometimes through an
 * indirection, e.g. `--seq-500: var(--accent)` — while a palette may override the same
 * token with a single light-tuned value. Whichever sheet wins the cascade decides which
 * of the two ships, so a flat override is not merely "less adaptive": it is a dark-mode
 * value that nobody chose, and it only becomes visible when the cascade order changes
 * (#1527). Two P1 regressions were found that way rather than by anyone reading a
 * palette: `word-cloud spectrum` fell from 14.50:1 to 1.16:1 on ardesia's dark canvas,
 * and `redline`'s struck clause to 1.25:1 on a11y-achromatopsia's dark slides.
 *
 * The check resolves BOTH sides through the merged map rather than comparing the
 * literal text, because the literal text misses exactly the family that caused the
 * worst regression — base's value there is `var(--accent)`, which reads flat and
 * resolves to a pair.
 *
 * Exempt: a palette with only a dark face (carbone) — see the note at the exemption
 * itself, which is a narrower call than it looks. A palette with only a LIGHT face is
 * NOT exempt: the a11y palettes pin `color-scheme: light` at `:root`, but that pin
 * reaches neither a per-slide `_class: dark`, which sets color-scheme on the SECTION
 * (#1323), nor the status-marker pseudo, which base.variants.css pins to
 * `color-scheme: dark` on every title / closing / non-light divider. Those two seams
 * are what the a11y status trio's dark arms exist for.

 *
 * Substitution is TEXTUAL and happens ANYWHERE in the value, not only when the

 * direction: `color-mix(in oklab, var(--accent) 92%, black)`,
 * `var(--accent, #006FA8)` and `oklch(from var(--accent) l c h)` are all
 * genuinely adaptive — each resolves through a pair — and a whole-value-only
 * matcher reads every one of them as flat and tells the author to add an arm it
 * already has. `color-mix()` derivation is the house idiom for the `-bg` family
 * and the nine derived `--seq-*` stops, so making it un-declarable would be a
 * gate that fails valid code.
 *
 * The arms are compared as STRINGS afterwards, so an expression that still
 * contains unresolved function syntax is fine: what decides the verdict is
 * whether the two schemes produce different text, which they do exactly when
 * some `light-dark()` in the chain contributed.
