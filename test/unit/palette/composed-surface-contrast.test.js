/**
 * Unit: the composed surfaces a COMPONENT paints, in both cascade orders.
 *
 * `test/unit/palette/theme-surface-aa.test.js` runs `tools/contrast-audit.js`'s
 * PAIRS — an ink against the two opaque canvases a palette declares. This runs
 * `tools/composed-contrast.js`'s SURFACES: the same inks on the surfaces
 * components actually build out of them — a 12% tint OF THE SAME TOKEN
 * (`redline`'s ins/del band, `checklist`'s state rows, `kpi`'s status pill,
 * `policy-recommendation`'s stance badge), that band on a second own-hue card,
 * and the OKLab ramp stops the BASE derives from a palette's `--seq-500` anchor
 * (`word-cloud spectrum`'s word fills).
 *
 * Born from #1640. Five brand palettes' redline runs and the word-cloud spectrum
 * on onyx / concrete / the four a11y palettes fell sub-threshold the moment the
 * palette won the cascade (#1527, flipped 2026-08-17) — and every gate in the repo
 * stayed green,
 * because contrast-audit checks each ink against `--bg` and never against the
 * `-bg` mix a component paints it on.
 *
 * If REGRESSION fails: a palette's own curated value is below its bar AND worse
 * than the base default it overrides, on a surface a component composes. Re-tune
 * the palette's arm (hue kept, moved along the OKLab lightness axis) until it
 * clears — solve against the BAND, which moves with the value. Do not delete the
 * surface.
 *
 * If UNLISTED / DEGRADED fails: a change added a sub-threshold composed pair, or
 * made an existing one worse. Fix the cause. The baseline is a record of a tracked
 * backlog (#1697, #1698), not a place to park new defects.
 *
 * If STALE fails: a pair in the baseline now passes. Delete its line — that is how
 * the backlog shrinks.
