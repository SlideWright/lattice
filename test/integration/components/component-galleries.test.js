/**
 * Integration: per-component gallery PDFs match the page count their
 * manifest implies via `expectedGallerySlideCount()`.
 *
 * This is the decentralized replacement for the central
 * test/fixtures/expected-page-counts.json snapshot (deleted in Phase 3
 * of the docs refactor). The expected count is DERIVED from the
 * manifest (title + sample + variant count + anti-patterns + closing),
 * not hand-maintained. Adding a variant to the manifest automatically
 * updates the expected count; a transform that silently drops a slide
 * fails the assertion.
 *
 * The two surviving top-level decks (gallery, gallery-mermaid) own
 * their counts inline in their own test files. (kpi-gallery was
 * retired in Phase 4; its regression signal now lives in the
 * per-component lib/components/kpi/kpi.gallery.pdf assertion below.)
 *
 * Cold runs are slow (one PDF per enriched component). The render
 * helper's cache hashes the manifest + styles.css + bundle so warm
 * runs are near-instant. CI disables the cache.
