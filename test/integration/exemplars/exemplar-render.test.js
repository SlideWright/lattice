/**
 * Integration: every worked exemplar deck renders cleanly, and its
 * committed PDF is fresh.
 *
 * The 45 worked exemplars (`exemplars/<sector>/<name>.md`, the "what
 * good looks like" library served by the Drawing Board's Drafting
 * picker) are a standing surface that must keep rendering as components
 * evolve — the maintenance debt the design doc flags
 * (engineering/decisions/2026-06-14-worked-exemplar-decks.md
 * § Maintenance). #341 authored them and #351 wired them into the app,
 * but nothing re-rendered them in CI; a component change could silently
 * break a deck or drop a slide and no gate would notice. This is that
 * gate.
 *
 * Each deck is rendered ONCE, as the full source (full ⊃ standard ⊃
 * short, so the full deck exercises every slide any tier can show; the
 * pure tier filter itself is unit-tested in
 * test/unit/exemplars/tier-filter.test.js). Two assertions per deck,
 * both off that single render plus the committed PDF's page count
 * (pdfinfo is instant):
 *
 *   1. Fresh render → page count === source slide count. The emulator
 *      throws on a render failure (empty/missing PDF); an exact page
 *      count catches a transform that silently drops or merges a slide.
 *   2. Committed PDF (HARD RULE #9) exists and its page count === source
 *      slide count. Catches a committed artifact gone stale against an
 *      edited source — the pre-commit auto-rebuild
 *      (tools/build-staged-pdfs.js) keeps it current, the on-demand
 *      `npm run build:exemplar-pdfs` regenerates after a component-wide
 *      reflow.
 *
 * This is a page-count gate, mirroring the per-component gallery gate
 * (test/integration/components/component-galleries.test.js); it does
 * NOT pixel-diff against a golden (that's the gallery `regress` tier's
 * job, and the exemplars were render-verified by eye in #341).
 *
 * Cold runs render 45 full decks (up to ~25 slides each) and are slow;
 * the render helper caches by input hash for warm local runs. CI
 * disables the cache and verifies the real build.
