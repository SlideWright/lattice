/**
 * Integration: deck-wide `class:` directive in front matter.
 *
 * Marpit's native spec is "spot replaces global" — a slide with
 * `<!-- _class: foo -->` discards the deck-wide `class:` value entirely.
 * Lattice intentionally diverges from that semantic via:
 *   - The `deckClassPropagate` plugin (runtime path,
 *     loaded by VS Code Marp preview and marp-cli)
 *   - The front-matter reader in lattice-emulator.js (emulator path)
 *
 * Both paths APPEND the deck-wide class tokens to every section's class
 * list, so `class: dark` + `_class: title` becomes `class="title dark"`.
 * Without this, deck-wide modifiers like `class: dark` are useless on
 * layout-heavy decks where every slide carries a `_class:` directive.
 *
 * This test pins the emulator side; the marp-cli reference is verified
 * by rendering and asserting the same merge in test/integration/marp.gallery.test.js.
 *
 * Renders the fixture through the cached emulator helper and inspects
 * the HTML sidecar (avoids parsing PDF). Slow tier because the
 * emulator always runs the Chromium PDF stage as part of its pipeline.
