/**
 * Integration: rebuild gallery.md through the lattice emulator and
 * assert the produced PDF matches the expected page count.
 *
 * Slow (~15s on cache miss; instant on hit). Lives under
 * test/integration so it doesn't run on the unit-test inner loop.
 *
 * The expected page count is inlined (was a shared fixture; that
 * fixture was deleted in Phase 3 of the docs refactor — per-component
 * decks self-derive their counts via expectedGallerySlideCount(), and
 * each surviving top-level deck owns its expected count inline).
