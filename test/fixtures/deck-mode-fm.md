# Slide One

Front-matter `mode: sketch` should apply the `sketch` class here, and
`finish: atrium` should apply `finish finish-atrium` — the two compose.

<!-- _class: cards-grid -->

## Slide Two

Per-slide `_class: cards-grid` should COMPOSE with the deck-wide `mode:` and
`finish:` registers, not replace them — this section must carry `cards-grid`,
`sketch`, and `finish-atrium`.

<!-- _class: boardroom -->

## Slide Three

A per-slide `_class: boardroom` opts THIS slide out of the deck-wide `mode:
sketch` (no `sketch` token here) — but the deck-wide `finish: atrium` backdrop
still applies.
