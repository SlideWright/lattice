# Test fixture deck

`Used by integration tests · do not edit casually`

A minimal 3-slide deck for fast integration tests. Add slides only if a
new test needs them — keeping this small keeps the integration tier fast.

## Final slide of the fixture deck.

The closing slide is here so tests can verify multi-slide behavior
(slide count, last-slide reachability) without relying on the larger
gallery.
