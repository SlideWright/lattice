/**
 * semantic-render — render a component example through the REAL emulator and
 * hand the resulting slide HTML to a headless browser for assertion.
 *
 * This is the foundation of the per-component SEMANTIC-INVARIANT suite — the
 * deterministic, machine-independent successor to pixel-golden comparison (P4
 * pivot; see engineering/decisions/2026-06-12-p4-regression-gate-retire-marp.md
 * §0). Instead of "do these pixels match a blessed PNG" (flaky across CI runners,
 * measures change not correctness), each component asserts on the MEANING of its
 * rendered DOM: required slots resolve, contrast passes, nothing overflows.
 *
 * WHY render through the emulator (not lib/engine directly): lib/engine's `css`
 * field is a stub — it emits the HTML contract but not the production cascade
 * (palette `@import`s, the marp scaffold, embedded fonts). Re-assembling that in a
 * test would duplicate a render kernel and invite drift (HARD RULE 1). The
 * emulator already writes a complete, production-faithful HTML document as a
 * sidecar next to its PDF, and test/helpers/render.js caches it by a content hash
 * of every render input — so we reuse that exact artifact. Same DOM + same CSS the
 * shipped `lattice` CLI produces.
 *
 * Determinism: computed styles, selector matches, and the overflow flag are
 * logical facts of the laid-out DOM (given the same Chromium + the emulator's
 * embedded fonts) — they do NOT carry the sub-pixel anti-aliasing that made the
 * pixel gate flake across machine classes.
