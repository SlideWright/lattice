# Legal layouts that read down the page.

`Feature · native → reflow · legal bucket · 2026-06-20`

The four legal multi-column layouts now collapse to a single column on a
square / tall / strip box — no portrait-specific variant authored into the
deck. Landscape renders byte-identically.

## What counts as "personal information" under CCPA.

`Cal. Civ. Code §1798.140(o) · CCPA/CPRA`

> "Personal information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.

- In plain English: any data tied to a household or device, not just a named person — IP addresses, cookie IDs, and device fingerprints are all in scope.
- **What we must do.**
  - Treat household-level identifiers as PI in our notice, retention, and DSAR workflows. Audit pixel and tag inventory next quarter.

## CCPA defines "sale" broadly.

`Cal. Civ. Code §1798.140(ad) · CCPA/CPRA`

> "Sale" means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating a consumer's personal information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.

- The catch is "other valuable consideration."
  - Data-for-service swaps and ad-tech cookie syncs can qualify as sales even when no money changes hands.

## What "personal data" covers under GDPR.

`GDPR Art. 4(1) · definitions`

> 'Personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

- In plain English.
  - Any online identifier that can single out a person — IP address, cookie ID, device fingerprint.
- **What we must do.**
  - Scope notice and retention to cover online identifiers, not just named-person records.

## The GDPR lawful-basis test.

`GDPR Art. 6(1)(f) · legitimate interests`

> Processing is lawful only if and to the extent that processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights of the data subject.

- Two-part test.
  - Necessity first, then a balancing exercise against the data subject's rights. Document both halves or the basis fails on audit.
