# The questions we know are coming.

`New component · inventory · stack · structure`

The end-of-pitch slide that pre-empts the room — the three or four hardest questions the audience will raise, each met with a prepared answer. The question reads as a prompt; the answer carries the substance.

<!-- _class: content -->

## A few defended answers, not a help page.

Q&A is a *function*, not a flat list: you anticipate the objection and close it on your own terms, which lands harder than waiting to be asked. Author it as a nested list — the top-level item is the question, the answer nests one level under it.

- Questions are indexed automatically, so a `ul` and an `ol` render the same — pick the look that fits the room, not the list marker.
- Five looks ship: the editorial **ledger** (default), `spine`, `rail`, `tab`, and `grid`. Plus the universal `solo`, `compact`, and `dark`.
- Distinct from a reference `faq` (many terse look-ups) and from `list-criteria` (criteria you score against). q-and-a *defends* a recommendation.

<!-- _class: q-and-a -->

`The ledger — default`

## What the board will press on.

- Why not extend the current vendor one more year?
  - The renewal lands in Q3 and locks us in through 2028. Switching now costs a single quarter of migration; switching after renewal costs three.
- What happens to the team mid-migration?
  - No headcount change. The same four engineers run both stacks through the eight-week overlap, then the legacy stack is decommissioned.
- How confident are we in the savings?
  - The $1.2M is contracted, not projected — the signed rate differential, before any usage growth.

<!-- _class: q-and-a spine -->

`Spine — a sequential walkthrough`

## Take the objections in order.

- Why not extend the current vendor one more year?
  - The renewal lands in Q3 and locks us in through 2028. Switching now costs a single quarter; switching after renewal costs three.
- What happens to the team mid-migration?
  - No headcount change. The same four engineers run both stacks through the eight-week overlap, then the legacy stack is decommissioned.
- How confident are we in the savings?
  - The $1.2M is contracted, not projected — the signed rate differential, before any usage growth.

<!-- _class: q-and-a rail -->

`Rail — question / answer columns`

## The exhibit version.

- Why not extend the current vendor one more year?
  - The renewal locks us in through 2028. Switching now costs one quarter; after renewal, three.
- What happens to the team mid-migration?
  - No headcount change — four engineers run both stacks through the eight-week overlap.
- How confident are we in the savings?
  - The $1.2M is contracted, not projected — the signed rate differential.

<!-- _class: q-and-a tab -->

`Tab — underlined prompts`

## The most editorial read.

- Why not extend the current vendor one more year?
  - The renewal lands in Q3 and locks us in through 2028. Switching now costs a single quarter; switching after renewal costs three.
- What happens to the team mid-migration?
  - No headcount change. The same four engineers run both stacks through the eight-week overlap.
- How confident are we in the savings?
  - The $1.2M is contracted, not projected — the signed rate differential.

---

<!-- _class: q-and-a grid -->

`Grid — two-up density`

## When you have a fourth.

- Why not extend the current vendor one more year?
  - The renewal locks us in through 2028; after renewal it costs three quarters.
- What happens to the team mid-migration?
  - No headcount change. Four engineers run both stacks through the eight-week overlap.
- How confident are we in the savings?
  - The $1.2M is contracted, not projected — the signed rate differential.
- What is the rollback plan?
  - A one-command revert to the pinned release, rehearsed weekly in staging.

---

<!-- _class: q-and-a solo -->

`Solo — one question, the whole slide`

## The one we know is coming.

- If the pilot fails, what have we actually lost?
  - One quarter and $180K, fully recoverable. The contract caps exposure at the pilot scope, with no auto-renewal and a thirty-day exit. The downside is bounded; the upside is the whole thesis.

---

<!-- _class: q-and-a compact -->

`Compact — five-plus pairs`

## Five we expect, numbered and tightened.

1. Why now rather than next fiscal year?
   1. The incentive credits expire in December; waiting forfeits $400K.
2. What is the rollback plan?
   1. A one-command revert to the pinned release, rehearsed weekly in staging.
3. Who signs off on go-live?
   1. The change-advisory board, the Thursday before each wave.
4. How does this affect the SLA?
   1. The 99.9% target holds — the migration runs behind a feature flag.
5. What if adoption stalls?
   1. Usage is opt-in for thirty days with a fallback, so a stall costs time, not money.

## Pre-empt the room.

`q-and-a`

When the hard questions are predictable, answer them before they are asked.
