# The universal pill

`Base · Finish · Structure`

One geometry for every status and metadata pill — consistent padding,
centre-aligned text, colour left to carry the meaning.

`Decision framework`

## Universal pills next to a sanctioned variant.

The date pills are the universal shape; the green status chips are the
bar-matching chart-status variant.

1. `2024 Q3` First workshop
   - The one where we agreed to agree on a definition of "signal." Output: a fifth workshop.
2. `2025 Q1` Framework approved `decision`
   - The steering committee accepts the scoring model. Build approved; the build team is the steering committee.
3. `2025 Q3` Pilot live `live`
   - Four product teams onboarded; the decision log opens. Eighteen entries to date, against roughly three hundred decisions made.
4. `2026 Q1` Operating rhythm `live`
   - The weekly review lands on every team's calendar. Attendance, like the calibration step, remains aspirational.

- Controller
  - The party that decides why and how personal data is processed, and carries the legal accountability for it.
- DSAR

- PII
  - Personal information that identifies a person, now read broadly enough to cover device IDs, cookies, and IP addresses.
- Processor
  - A party that processes data on the controller's instructions — a vendor, not the decision-maker.

# Structure unifies, colour signals

`--pill-radius · --pill-pad-y · --pill-pad-x · --pill-weight`

Keep pill text to one (hyphenated is fine) or two words. Geometry comes
from the `--pill-*` tokens; `--pill-fg` / `--pill-bg` / `--pill-border`
carry the semantics.
