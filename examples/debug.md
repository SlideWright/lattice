`Feature demo · debug overlay`

# See the boxes your layout is made of.

Set `debug: on-hover` in the front matter and every preview — Playground, Drawing
Board, Studio — outlines each box by its **layout mode**; **hover** one to read its
label. It travels with the deck, and it is **stripped from every export**, so a
boardroom PDF is byte-identical whether debug is on or off.

---

## Read the grid at a glance.

At rest you see only the outlines — each box colored by how it lays its children
out: **grid** (blue), **flex** (vermillion), **flow** (gray). **Hover** any box to
reveal its label (and its containers') in full detail. Want the whole map pinned on
at once instead? Use `debug: on-always`.

<!-- _debug: on-hover verbose -->

## Pull every lever on one slide.

`<!-- _debug: on-hover verbose -->` turns on the full set — `identity · layout · size
· class · box` — for **this slide only**. The deck-wide `debug: on-hover` stays the
default everywhere else; a spot directive just overrides the box it sits on.

- Sizes are the **intrinsic** pixel box, read straight off the layout — not the
  scaled-down thumbnail you see in the filmstrip.
- `class` shows the raw CSS classes; `box` shows padding + gap. Both are opt-in,
  because on a dense slide they are more than you usually want to read.

<!-- _debug: off -->

## Mute a slide you have already checked.

`<!-- _debug: off -->` silences the overlay on one slide even while the deck is
debugging — handy once a layout is settled and the boxes are just noise. `off` is
also the default everywhere: with no `debug:` key at all, the preview is clean.

Because labels are summoned by default, a busy grid never becomes a wall of chips:
you pull detail in only where you look — **hover** on desktop, **tap** on touch —
one box (and its containers) at a time.

# Debug in the preview. Ship it clean.

`debug: on-hover` is an authoring aid, not a deck style — the engine strips it from
the PDF, PPTX, and HTML exports, so it can never end up in front of a board.
