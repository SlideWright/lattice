`Finish · the sketch modifier`

# A boardroom deck, drawn by hand.

The `sketch` finish swaps Lattice into a hand-drawn skin — felt-tip headings, a legible hand-sans for body, and boxes that read as sketched. It is palette-blind, so any theme colours it; here it rides the `carta` paper-and-ink palette.

`How it works`

## Form, not colour.

Turn it on once with `class: sketch` in the front matter and it propagates to every slide. Every stroke is drawn in a palette token, so swapping `theme: carta` for `theme: indaco` recolours the whole sketch in blue without touching a layout.

`Why it reads as hand-made`

## Three moves do the work.

- Handwriting
  - Caveat carries the headings; Shantell Sans keeps body prose legible across a dense slide.
- Drawn boxes
  - An asymmetric corner radius plus an offset ink stroke turns each card into a sketched rectangle.
- A human tilt
  - Every other card rotates a fraction of a degree, so the grid reads placed-by-hand, not stamped.

`The finish travels`

## It is not tied to one layout.

- Palette-blind by contract
  - Colours resolve through `var(--token)`, so the finish never assumes a hue — it inherits the active theme's.
- PDF-safe by design
  - The look is pure type and border geometry; no SVG filters, which collapse Marp's print scaling.
- Opt body back to clean
  - Add `sketch-clean-body` to keep the hand headings and boxes while prose returns to the crisp engine face.

`Charts under sketch`

## The frame is drawn; the data is exact.

Because the finish is CSS and fonts, it reskins the heading and the HTML legend — but a chart's SVG wedges keep their own precise geometry, so the numbers never wobble.

`Finish · sketch`

## Sketched, but still boardroom.

Pair `sketch` with `carta` for paper-and-ink, or with any palette for the same hand on a different page.
