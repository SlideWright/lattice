# Dense lists, split with a cover

`Fit Ladder · the cover-paginate move`

A long register can't shrink to fit — so when it overflows, the engine leads with a cover, then flows the layout's own cards on. Same deck, just more of it.

## What cover-paginate adds

- A dense list overflows? It can't drop a type size — readability is the floor
- So the engine **leads with an accent cover** — a heading, a semantic intro, a forward arrow
- Then it flows the layout's **own native cards** on clean pages — never flattened to generic rows
- A small **progress rail** ties the run together — k-of-N, beside the page number (`autosplit: on`)

## What the board will press on.

- Why not extend the current vendor one more year?
  - The renewal lands in Q3 and locks us in through 2028. Switching now costs a single quarter of migration; switching after renewal costs three.
- What happens to the team mid-migration?
  - No headcount change. The same four engineers run both stacks through the eight-week overlap, then the legacy stack is decommissioned.
- How confident are we in the savings?
  - The $1.2M is contracted, not projected — the signed rate differential, before any usage growth.
- What is the rollback plan if the cutover fails?
  - The legacy stack stays warm for the full overlap; a failed cutover reverts in under an hour with no data loss.

<!-- _class: glossary -->

## Glossary

- Consent
  - A freely given, specific, informed agreement to processing — pre-ticked boxes don't count.
- Controller
  - The party that decides why and how personal data is processed, and carries the legal accountability for it.
- DSAR
  - Data Subject Access Request — a person's demand to see, correct, or delete the data held on them, on a 45-day clock.
- Legitimate interest
  - A lawful basis that balances the controller's purpose against the data subject's rights, no consent required.
- PII
  - Personal information that identifies a person, now read broadly enough to cover device IDs, cookies, and IP addresses.
- Processor
  - A party that processes data on the controller's instructions — a vendor, not the decision-maker.
- Pseudonymisation
  - Replacing identifiers with tokens so data can't be tied to a person without separately held keys.
- Special category
  - Sensitive data — health, biometrics, beliefs — carrying heightened processing conditions.
