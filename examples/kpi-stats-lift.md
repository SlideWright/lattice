`Authoring · Slot-header lift`

# Numbers without the asterisks.

`kpi` and `stats` now bold their figures for you — the `**…**` is optional.

<!-- _class: list -->
<!-- _footer: "What changed" -->

## One authoring contract, two fewer footguns.

- Parent list item is the number
  - It renders in display type automatically — typing `**$2.4B**` is now an idempotent no-op, never wrong.
- Detail lives in the nested sublist
  - The nested body is what tells the engine where the number ends, exactly like every other slot layout.
- `stats` lost its magic
  - The old parse-and-rebuild into `.stats-row` is gone; the list is styled directly, so all three render paths agree.

## Same numbers, less markup.
