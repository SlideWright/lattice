# Four charts, four keys — each one SVG.

`piechart · radar · map · cohort quadrant · 2026-06-13`

The diagram, the gradient spine, and the legend now share a single viewBox on
every keyed chart, so the whole thing scales as one proportional unit — and the
four read as one family.

<!-- _class: piechart -->
<!-- _footer: "Default — disc · spine · key, one unit" -->

`H1 2026 · 1,840 person-hours`

## Where the planning quarter actually went.

The key scales with the diagram; the spine floats in a comfortable gap.

- Deck production `46%`
- Meetings about meetings `22%`
- Realigning on priorities `18%`
- Stakeholder management `9%`
- Actually deciding `5%`

<!-- _class: piechart donut -->
<!-- _footer: "Donut — same unit, hollow centre" -->

`H1 2026 · 1,840 person-hours`

## The engineering quarter, as a donut.

Wedges, spine and key are all emitted in viewBox units.

## Eleven slices still fit — the legend scales itself down.

No clipping: the font shrinks just enough to seat every keyed row.

- Signal Intake engineering `28%`
- Scoring policy work `16%`
- Decision Log integration `13%`
- Per-team calibration `11%`
- Explaining the framework to stakeholders `9%`

<!-- _class: piechart cover -->
<!-- _footer: "Cover — the whole unit scales up, key included" -->

`H1 2026 · 1,840 person-hours`

## Where the planning quarter actually went.

Cover just works — the key scales up with the diagram, no special-casing.

<!-- _class: piechart dark -->
<!-- _footer: "Dark — every colour is a palette token" -->

`H1 2026 · dark canvas`

## Spine, swatches, labels — all token-driven.

Every colour flips with the canvas; nothing is a baked literal.

## How we stack up across the buying criteria.

The key rides the same shared builder — swatch, label, spine — keyed off the
series colour instead of a wedge.

<!-- _class: map -->
<!-- _footer: "Map — swatches mirror the choropleth ramp; values right-aligned" -->

## Where our programs reached — unevenly.

Each swatch is the region's own fill, so the key reads as a legend of the map
itself.

# One viewBox, and it travels.

`piechart · radar · map · cohort quadrant`

Proportional at any size, self-contained for export, accessible (the key is
re-stated in a `<desc>`), and still palette-blind and sketch-aware — one shared
builder under all four keyed charts.
