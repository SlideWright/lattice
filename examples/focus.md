# Focus one thing.

`Feature · focus & highlighting`

A dense slide is a reading slide. When you present it live, you focus the room on one thing at a time — a row, a column, a card, a line of code. `_focus:` makes that a one-line directive, and it survives PDF and PPTX.

---

<!-- _class: divider -->

## The slide stays dense. The attention does not.

You don't simplify the data — you direct the eye. One ordinal grammar addresses any surface: `row`, `col`, `cell`, `item`, `line`. The look is content-aware by default, and palette-blind.
