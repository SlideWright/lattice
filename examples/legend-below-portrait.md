# The key belongs below the dial.

`piechart · radar · quadrant · map · portrait · 2026-06-19`

On a tall deck the four keyed charts used to letterboxe into a short band — the diagram and its right-rail legend are one wide SVG unit. In portrait the legend now stacks *beneath* the diagram, so the whole chart fills the box.

---

<!-- _class: content -->

## Same chart, restructured for the box.

These four charts bake the diagram **and** the legend into a single `<svg>` viewBox, so CSS can't reflow the key. The fix is render-time: the kernel reads the deck's orientation and emits a tall, legend-below composition.

- **Landscape is untouched** — byte-identical to before. The right-rail layout runs when the deck isn't portrait.
- **Portrait stacks** — dial on top, key centered below, a soft accent rule between them.
- Author nothing new. The same Markdown adapts to the `size:` you render at.

<!-- _class: quote -->

## Landscape unchanged. Portrait, finally whole.

The legend-below layout is gated on the deck's orientation, so a 16:9 boardroom deck renders exactly as it always did — while the same source, exported to a story or mobile size, fills the tall canvas instead of stranding the chart in a band.
