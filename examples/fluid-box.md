`Viewer · Responsive reading`

# Read it on your phone.

`A fixed 16:9 deck, opened on a phone — reflowed to portrait, one slide per screen. Same deck, no re-authoring.`

<!-- _class: list -->
<!-- _footer: "What fluid-box does" -->

## The deck stays fixed. The reading goes fluid.

- A deck is authored once at a fixed shape
  - The PDF and the canonical export are untouched — fluid-box never changes an exported byte.
- The viewer unbolts the box from that shape
  - Each slide sizes to the viewport instead of the authored 16:9, so a phone makes it portrait.
- The existing runtime does the rest
  - It re-derives orientation from the measured box and every component reflows to its tall layout for free.

`Impact · Pilot Results`

## Six months of results across four product teams.

`In landscape these sit in a row; on a phone they stack into a single column.`

## One flag, one toggle.

- Export a fluid viewer
  - `lattice-emulator deck.md out.pdf --fluid` writes `out.html` as the viewer; the PDF is unchanged.
- It is opt-in, off by default
  - The viewer opens fluid on a phone and as the authored deck on a laptop; a pill toggles between them.
- Reflow is wired; density is next
  - A slide that overpacks a phone screen can still overflow — autofit and re-pagination are the sequenced follow-ups.

## Same deck. A reading that fits the screen.
