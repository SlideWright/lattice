`Lattice · Feature deck`

# Native state machines in plain markdown.

Numbered list, inline-code transitions, palette-blind SVG. No Mermaid, no charting library, no layout engine.

---

<!-- _class: subtopic -->

## What this deck shows.

A finite-state machine authored as an ordered list. Each top-level item is a state; the index becomes a stable ref. Nested bullets carry the outgoing transitions, each a single inline-code arrow like `submit => 2` or `revise => self`. Whitespace inside the inline code is insignificant. The browser measures the laid-out nodes and draws the SVG edges, so it sizes to any content. Two orthogonal modifier classes: direction — `lr` (left-to-right, Mermaid `direction LR`) or the default top-to-bottom — and presentation — `inline` (transitions as chips, no SVG). They compose. `dark` composes on top.

`Submission lifecycle`

## Document approval flow.

How a draft moves from author to archive.

1. Draft `start`
   - `submit => 2`
   - `discard => 6`
2. Submitted `on-track`
   - `review => 3`
3. In Review
   - `approve => 4`
   - `reject => 1`
   - `revise => self`
4. Approved `done`
   - `publish => 5`
5. Published `live`
   - `archive => 6`
6. Archived `end`

*Rejected drafts return to the author; revisions stay in review.*

## Job runner.

1. Idle `start`
   - `start => 2`
2. Running
   - `done => 3`
   - `fail => 1`
3. Done `end`

## Connection retry.

1. Connecting `start`
   - `retry => self`
   - `ok => 2`
   - `fail => 3`
2. Connected `live`
   - `disconnect => 1`
3. Failed `end`

## Build pipeline.

1. Source `start`
   - `compile => 2`
2. Compiled
   - `test => 3`
3. Tested
   - `deploy => 4`

## Why a native state chart.

Mermaid's `stateDiagram-v2` works, but theming it cleanly requires a CSS override cascade with `!important` (see `docs/theming.md`). The native chart uses palette tokens directly — `var(--c1-light)`, `var(--c-stroke)`, `var(--c-line)`, `var(--c-ink-light)` — and inherits dark / light, every theme, automatically. No mmdc subprocess, no opaque SVG class names, no version coupling. The trade-off: no hierarchical states, no parallel regions, no guards in v1. When you need those, `<!-- _class: diagram -->` is the Mermaid escape hatch.
