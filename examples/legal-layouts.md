`How to read this deck`

## Each anchor opens with a section divider, then walks five visual treatments of the same idea.

Mark the one that earns the room. Slot labels lift via the slotLabelLift transform — author writes `- Federal`, not `- **Federal**`. The obligation matrix uses the universal `[x] [-] [ ]` state grammar shared with verdict-grid and checklist.

## Children's data — three jurisdictions, three obligations.

- Federal
  - `15 U.S.C. §6501 · COPPA`
  - Verifiable parental consent for under-13 personal data.
  - Operators must post a clear notice and a deletion route.
  - `In effect since 2000`
- State
  - `Cal. Civ. Code §1798.120 · CCPA/CPRA`
  - Opt-in for selling or sharing under-16 data; opt-out for over-16.
  - DSAR handling within 45 days; deletion verified.
  - `Enforced 2023`
- Local
  - `NYC Admin Code §22-1201`
  - Bias-audit obligation for AEDTs used in employment decisions.
  - Annual audit + candidate notice + public summary.
  - `Effective 2023`

Pick this when the room wants three parallel facts at a glance.

## Children's data — Federal floor, State stricter, Local narrowest.

- Federal
  - `15 U.S.C. §6501 · COPPA`
  - Verifiable parental consent for under-13 personal data; nationwide floor.
- State
  - `Cal. Civ. Code §1798.120 · CCPA/CPRA`
  - Opt-in for selling under-16 data; California raises the floor for its residents.
- Local
  - `NYC Admin Code §22-1201`
  - Annual bias-audit obligation for employment AEDTs; narrowest scope.

Pick this when the room needs to see scope shrinking as the tier descends.

## Three jurisdictions, full prose, one row each.

  - `In effect since 2000`
- State
  - `Cal. Civ. Code §1798.120 · CCPA/CPRA`
  - Opt-in for selling or sharing under-16 data; 45-day DSAR response.

- Local
  - `NYC Admin Code §22-1201`
  - Annual bias-audit obligation for employment AEDTs; candidate notice required.
  - `Effective 2023`

Pick this when each row has more than a sentence to carry.

## Federal floor → State adds opt-in → Local adds audit duty.

- Federal
  - `15 U.S.C. §6501 · COPPA`
  - Verifiable parental consent for under-13 PI; this is the floor.
- State
  - `Cal. Civ. Code §1798.120 · CCPA/CPRA`
  - California adds opt-in for sale or sharing of under-16 data.
- Local
  - `NYC §22-1201`
  - New York City adds an annual AEDT bias-audit duty on top.

Pick this when the relationship between tiers is the point — not parallel facts.

## SB-362 rewrote the opt-out link rule.

`Cal. Civ. Code §1798.135 · amendment SB-362 (2024)`

> A business that <del>collects</del> <ins>collects, sells, or shares</ins> consumers' personal information shall provide <del>two or more</del> <ins>at least one</ins> designated method for submitting requests to opt-out, <ins>including, at minimum, a clear and conspicuous link on the homepage titled "Your Privacy Choices,"</ins> for use by consumers to <del>opt out of the sale of</del> <ins>direct the business not to sell or share</ins> their personal information.

- **Why this matters** SB-362 collapses "sale" and "sharing" into one duty and pins a uniform link title — homepage chrome and DSAR workflows both need a uniform UX.

## SB-362 rewrote the opt-out link rule — side-by-side.

`Cal. Civ. Code §1798.135 · before vs after`

> A business that **collects** consumers' personal information shall provide **two or more** designated methods for submitting requests to opt-out for use by consumers to **opt out of the sale of** their personal information.

> A business that **collects, sells, or shares** consumers' personal information shall provide **at least one** designated method for submitting requests to opt-out, including a clear and conspicuous homepage link titled **"Your Privacy Choices,"** for use by consumers to **direct the business not to sell or share** their personal information.

1. **Scope** Sale and sharing now both trigger the opt-out duty — even free programs are in.
2. **Floor** Two-channel minimum drops to one; a homepage link plus a portal is now sufficient.
3. **Chrome** The literal link title is now mandated — uniform branding across the web.

## What this deck delivers.

- Six anchor layouts cover jurisdiction, quotation, regime matrix, motion, redline, and authority.
- Five visual variants per anchor — the strongest of each becomes the shipped default.
- Lean authoring: slot labels auto-lift, `[x] [-] [ ]` for state markers, pin-cite typography throughout.
- Three-renderer parity: marp-cli, emulator, and runtime all process the same transforms.
- The other four variants per anchor can be deleted before graduation into the gallery.
