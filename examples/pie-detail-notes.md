# Per-slice detail, in the PDF.

`piechart · speaker-notes channel`

A pie slice can carry an indented sub-list. On screen it reveals on hover/tap; in the exported PDF it rides the slide's **speaker note** — so a reader gets the context off the slide face, and the chart pixels stay byte-identical.

---

<!-- _class: statement silent -->

## One source, two surfaces.

The sublist under a slice powers **both** the Present-mode reveal popover **and** the static-PDF speaker note (`Label (value): item · item`). Open this PDF's note annotations — or the `.notes.txt` sidecar — to read each slice's detail.

# Read the notes.

`open the annotations`

The detail never crowds the boardroom slide — it waits in the speaker-notes channel for the reader who wants it.
