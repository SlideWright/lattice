// The deck "Slide size" picker options — the curated subset of the engine's
// `@size` registry (lib/_theme.css) surfaced in the deck-config drawer, with
// human labels. Kept as data (not inlined in deck-config.js) so a unit test can
// assert every value here is a real registered `@size` AND that the social/mobile
// sizes are present — the drift guard that this list missed when #399 added the
// portrait formats (the engine had them; this picker did not).
//
// Aliases (16:9 / 9:16 / 4:5 / 1:1 / HD / 4k) are intentionally omitted — a picker
// wants one entry per format, by its semantic name. Labels are geometry only
// (name · aspect · dimensions): Lattice describes formats by shape, never by
// platform/brand — those date fast and aren't ours to borrow.
//
// test/unit/playground/deck-sizes.test.js guards this against lib/_theme.css.

// Value = the memorable name written to the markdown (`size: story`); label =
// name · resolution (ratio) for the picker. Markdown stays human-readable; the
// UI carries the extra detail.
