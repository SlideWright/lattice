// Build-time asset-version resolver for the playground's runtime-fetched
// assets (the engine bundle, the runtime bundle, and the theme/engine CSS).
//
// THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES. Those three are served from FIXED public/ URLs
// (`playground/themes/lattice.css`, `playground/lattice-runtime.js`,
// `playground/lattice-playground.js`). Astro content-hashes its own page JS,
// so a redeploy refreshes the page — but the fixed-URL assets are cached by
// the browser/CDN and served stale. The visible failure: after a release the
// component list (baked into the fresh page JS) shows a new component, but the
// stale `lattice.css` lacks its rules, so it renders unstyled (a blank funnel,
// a collapsed pricing grid). See the 2026-06 funnel/pricing incident.
//
// THE FIX. `sync-playground-assets.mjs` stages those assets into a
// content-hashed directory `public/playground/v/<hash>/…` each build; this
// resolver returns that `<hash>` so the pages can build cache-busted URLs
// (`playground/v/<hash>/themes/lattice.css`). A content change → a new hash →
// a new URL → a guaranteed cache miss → fresh assets. No change to the fetch
// sites (they only append a filename to `themeBase`).
//
// Build-time only — it reads the filesystem, so it runs in Astro frontmatter
// (SSG, Node), never in a client bundle. Falls back to '' (the legacy
// unversioned base) if sync hasn't run, so an editor/import can't hard-fail.
//
// ANCHOR THE LOOKUP TO THE PROJECT ROOT, NOT `import.meta.url`. Astro/Vite
// BUNDLES this module for the production SSR build and relocates it, so an
// `import.meta.url`-relative path no longer points at `docs/src/playground/` —
// `readdirSync` then throws, the catch swallows it, `assetVersion()` returns
// '', and every page emits the UNVERSIONED fallback URLs
// (`playground/themes/<name>.css`, `playground/lattice-runtime.js`). Those
// files don't exist (sync only writes the *versioned* tree), so the live
// playground + every component specimen 404'd on the engine CSS and the
// runtime. `process.cwd()` is the docs project root under both `astro build`
// and `astro dev` (and any `docs/`-scoped npm script), which survives
// bundling; the `import.meta.url` path stays as a belt-and-braces fallback for
// a plain-Node importer run from elsewhere. See engineering/gotchas.md
// "Playground/specimen previews 404 on the engine CSS + runtime".
