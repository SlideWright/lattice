// preview-host.js — pure, import-free host classification for the guided tour.
//
// Extracted from guided-tour.js (which pulls in driver.js + CSS, docs-only deps
// absent from CI's root install) so the Node unit suite can test it directly.
//
// A host that is unambiguously a dev / PR-preview surface — never a production
// site. `*.pages.dev` is Cloudflare Pages (every preview today is served there;
// the production docs are GitHub Pages), and localhost is `astro dev`/`preview`.
// Used as a RUNTIME backstop so the tour's pointer-trapping overlay never runs
// on a preview even when the build-time `CF_PAGES` stamp is missing/wrong.
