// Shared on-demand loader for the irreducible marp render engine
// (window.LatticePlayground, the ~1.8MB/554KB-gz `lattice-playground.js`
// bundle). WRAP, DON'T REINVENT — this never reimplements the engine; it only
// controls *when* the existing classic <script> is injected.
//
// The shadcn migration loaded this bundle EAGERLY via `<script defer src>` in
// the <head> of every app page, so it competed with first paint and tanked
// mobile LCP even though the live preview is below the fold (landing) or after
// first paint (playground/workbench). This module injects the same script
// ON DEMAND — the first time a surface actually needs the engine (island in
// view, app mounted, idle) — and resolves once `window.LatticePlayground` is
// set. The existing bridges/studios already poll for that global and tolerate
// it arriving late, so deferring the injection is safe.
//
// Idempotent: a module-level singleton keyed by URL. Concurrent or repeated
// callers share one <script> and one Promise; if the engine is already present
// (e.g. another surface, or a re-mount) it resolves immediately.

// `window.LatticePlayground` is declared once, canonically, in playground-global.d.ts.

// One in-flight/settled promise per engine URL (URLs are content-hashed, so a
// single page only ever sees one). Survives React StrictMode double-mounts and
// multiple islands on the same page.
