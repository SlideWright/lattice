	// Three things changed here (2026-08-03), each fixing a way the old version quietly
	// did nothing:
	//   · WINDOW, not one slide. It warmed exactly `clamped + 1`, so a 2-sentence slide
	//     followed by an 8-sentence one warmed a fraction of what was about to be spoken.
	//     The depth is a workspace pref, `auto` by default → sized from the measured p95
	//     synth latency for the ACTIVE voice (narration-prefs.js), so a slow link warms
	//     deeper without anyone configuring anything.
	//   · Not autoplay-only. It required `autoplay`, so arrow-key navigation — how a
	//     presenter actually drives a deck — prefetched nothing whatsoever. Voice being ON
	//     is the honest signal of intent to hear audio; that is the gate now. This also
	//     covers Present opening with Voice already on, and the moment the user unmutes:
	//     both land here, so the CURRENT slide is warm before Play is ever pressed.
	//   · The current slide is in the window. It was assumed already playing; on open (or
	//     on unmute before Play) it is not, and that first cold sentence IS the "press play
	//     and wait" the reporter described.
	// Still gated on `!muted`: never synthesize — never BILL — audio the user won't hear.
	//
	// KNOWN, ACCEPTED GAP (red-team finding, carried forward): a chain of several
	// consecutive EMPTY slides advances almost instantly (the skip-effect below), so this
	// re-fires at each transient index with little head start. A deeper window makes this

	//
	// It never needed to. The rail's prefetch front is contiguous from the playhead by
	// construction: it stops at the first slide that is not fully cached, because you would
	// stall at that gap before reaching anything beyond it. Slides far ahead therefore cannot
	// change what is drawn until you get there. Bounding the question at the lookahead depth
	// plus a small margin removes the deck-size term entirely — and at that point the store's
	// single `getAllKeys` is comfortably the right primitive, which is the other half of the
	// lesson: the previous attempt here replaced that read with one probe per sentence, on the
	// reasoning that it should scale with the deck rather than the store, and measured 7x SLOWER
	// on an empty store — the state every new user is in. It was reverted. Ask a smaller
	// question, don't buy a cleverer answer.

	// is floored at the playhead — but the per-slide `ready` array also feeds the rail's
	// assistive label, and presenters step backwards constantly. Without it, tabbing to the slide
	// you just left would stop announcing "narration ready" for audio that is plainly cached.
	//
	// WHAT THE WINDOW MAY NOT DO IS SHRINK WHAT THE RAIL DRAWS. Readiness reads the on-device
	// store, so a deck PREPARED in an earlier session is cached end to end — and a windowed poll
	// that zero-fills everything outside its bounds reports a 5-slide runway on a 60-slide deck
	// that is fully ready, because `prefetchFrontOf` stops at the first unmeasured slide. That
	// turns "prepared" into a bar that looks unprepared, on the one indicator whose entire job is
	// telling a buffering deck from a broken one (#1389). The optimization would have eaten the
	// feature it was optimizing.
	//
	// So: one FULL sweep when Present opens (or the deck changes), then windowed refreshes that
	// MERGE into what is already known instead of replacing it. The repeating 2s cost — the one

	//
	// CROSS-FRAME. The slide is a same-origin iframe and Vetrina's stage never enters one. The

{/* The slide is CENTERED and takes the largest 16:9 box its space allows — in
			    BOTH axes, so whatever room exists above and below is filled by the slide
			    itself rather than left as dead space (#1282).

			    This is pure layout: no ResizeObserver, no measured width in React state, no
			    inline geometry. The sizer is a SIZE container and the card asks for
			    `min(100cqw, 100cqh × 16/9)` — the identical formula the old JS computed, but
			    resolved by the engine at layout time. That removes a whole class of bug the
			    measured version had: a first paint at the stale 960px seed, a resize the
			    observer hasn't seen yet, and the iPad stretch case (#1227) where WebKit
			    resolved a stretched height against that first-layout max-width and never
			    re-resolved it. There is nothing left to go stale.

			    Vertical padding matches the READ stop's preview holder (`p-4 sm:p-5`), so
			    the slide sits in the same frame in both places.

			    The bottom grows to `pb-14` ONLY while a transient pill is up — the
			    first-run cue, or a rehearsal in progress. Those pills are `absolute …
			    bottom-2/3` against THE ROW, not the card; because the sizer stretches to the
			    row's CONTENT box the card can never reach into that band (nothing is ever
			    drawn on top of the slide) while an absolutely-positioned child resolves
			    against the PADDING box and lands inside it. Reserving it unconditionally
			    cost the slide ~56px it could otherwise fill, for a cue shown once ever.
			    The reserve is keyed on `rehearse && playing`, not on the current coach BEAT:
			    a beat comes and goes as you cross its mark, so keying on the beat would
			    resize the slide repeatedly mid-rehearsal. Keyed on the session it is one
			    transition in and one out — the same shape as the caption band appearing on
			    Play, which is the responsive behavior this is modeled on.

			    `items-center` on the sizer stays LOAD-BEARING (#1227): default `stretch`
			    makes a flex item's cross size definite, which beats `aspect-ratio` per spec
			    and would flatten the card. Centering the card removes the stretch. */}
