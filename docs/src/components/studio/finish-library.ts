// The Studio finish library — a thin wrapper over the SHARED Workbench asset store
// (asset-store.js, IndexedDB `lattice-workbench`), the same shelf the theme +
// component libraries use. REUSE, DON'T REINVENT (HARD RULE #15): a finish you
// design + save in the Finish faculty lands beside your saved themes and
// components, survives a reload, and becomes pickable in the Inspector Finish menu
// (where its CSS is injected into the deck preview + its class applied — the
// consumption loop). Degrades gracefully when IndexedDB is unavailable (private
// mode / SSR / jsdom) so a read never throws — it just returns an empty shelf.
