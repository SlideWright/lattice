# Part 4: Layout Templates

All layouts are 1280×720 (16:9). Slide padding: 48-64px. Usable content area: approximately 1160×600.

28 templates plus 4 documented variants. CSS class names shown in `monospace` — use directly in `<!-- _class: name -->` directives.

## Layout Inventory: Structured vs Unstructured

Every layout falls into one of two categories. The distinction matters because it changes what the source markdown looks like and where bugs are most likely to live.

**Structured layouts** are post-processed by `lattice-emulator.js`: a flat `ul`/`ol` (sometimes with nested children) is rewritten into purpose-built DOM (`.card`, `.stat-item`, `.vcard`, `.feat-card`, `.compare-prose-inner`, `.panel-left`/`.panel-right`, etc.). The CSS targets that generated structure. Authors write a list; the post-processor turns it into the layout.

**Unstructured layouts** are rendered by CSS alone from the semantic markdown that Marp emits. No DOM rewriting happens — the headings, paragraphs, and lists you write are the headings, paragraphs, and lists the CSS styles.

| Category     | Class                                                                                                                                           | Post-processor                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Structured   | `cards-grid`, `cards-side`, `cards-stack`, `cards-wide`, `checklist`, `compare-prose`, `compare-code`, `featured`, `list-criteria`, `list-tabular`, `split-panel`, `stats`, `verdict-grid` | yes — `lattice-emulator.js` rewrites DOM |
| Unstructured | `title`, `divider`, `subtopic`, `closing`, `content`, `diagram`, `quote`, `list`, `list-steps`, `timeline`, `big-number`, `image`, `image left`, `image-full`, `code`         | no — CSS-only                   |

Modifiers (`dark`, image variants like `image left`, etc.) compose with both categories.

**Authoring implication:** every structured layout has a single canonical list shape documented in its template entry. Deviating from that shape (wrong list type, wrong nesting depth, missing `**Title.**` marker, etc.) causes the post-processor to fall back to the raw list rendering, which the CSS does not style. When a structured slide looks wrong, check the source list shape first.

**Audit implication:** structured layouts are where `lattice-emulator.js` and `marp-cli` are most likely to diverge — see [audit.md §11.4](./audit.md#114-comparison-workflow).

## Eyebrow Labels

Many templates show a small label above the main heading — called an **eyebrow**. It identifies section, category, or slide type at a glance.

**Authoring syntax:** a paragraph containing only a single inline code span, placed immediately above the heading **or above a list** (e.g. `big-number`). The eyebrow is optional — omit it if no label is needed:

```markdown
`Section 01 · Foundations`

# Section Title
```

```markdown
`Context · Competitive Dynamics`

## Slide Heading
```

```markdown
`Calibration Result · 6-Month Pilot`

- 14×
  - Description text.
```

The CSS detects this pattern (`p:has(> code:only-child) + h1/h2/…`) and renders the code element as a mono uppercase label, without touching the heading hierarchy. This makes eyebrows **markdown-lint compliant**: a `<p>` containing code is not a heading and cannot violate heading-order rules.

**Styling:** `--font-mono`, 13px (`--fs-label`), 600 weight, 0.18em letter-spacing, uppercase, `--text-muted`. Dark bookend slides (title, divider, closing) override the color to `--on-dark-secondary` / `--on-dark-ghost` automatically.

**The inline-code paragraph is the universal eyebrow pattern** across every layout. `h3` is reserved for genuine structural sub-headings (notably the left-panel rubric in `split-panel`) and is no longer used as a label. Standardising on the inline-code form keeps eyebrows markdown-lint compliant on every slide regardless of the heading levels that follow.

**Note on `split-panel`:** the inline-code eyebrow paragraph is placed **between `h2` and `h3`** in the source. The CSS grid fallback routes it to the left dark panel automatically. (`h5` is no longer required here.)

**Exception — `title` layout:** Placing an inline-code paragraph before `h1` triggers **MD041** (_first-heading-h1_) in markdownlint, because the paragraph becomes the first content element in the file. On `title` slides, the order is therefore reversed: `h1` comes first (satisfying MD041), and the inline-code eyebrow is placed immediately **after** `h1`. CSS on `section.title h1 + p:has(> code:only-child)` overrides the normal subtitle rule and renders the code element with eyebrow styling instead. A plain paragraph following that inline-code block is treated as the subtitle (see below). Divider slides mid-document are not affected — they are not the first element in the file, so MD041 does not fire there and the eyebrow-before-`h1` pattern remains valid.

## Subtitle Labels

Many templates carry an optional short descriptor line immediately below the main heading — a **subtitle**. It adds context, a process label, or a qualifying clause without becoming a second heading.

**Authoring syntax:** a paragraph containing only a single inline code span, placed immediately below the heading:

```markdown
## How signals move from input to decision.

`Four-stage processing pipeline — weekly cadence`
```

The CSS detects `h* + p:has(> code:only-child)` and renders the code element as body-font italic in `--text-muted` — no pill, no mono, no uppercase. Layout-specific `> p` rules (diagram, stats, title, closing, subtopic) already govern the container's size, weight, and color; the subtitle block only strips the pill and applies italic.

This replaces the `_em paragraph_` pattern (`_text_`) for post-heading descriptors — both are valid Markdown, but the inline-code form is more explicit about intent and keeps the two roles visually distinguishable in the source.

**Exception — `title` layout:** On `title` slides the inline-code paragraph after `h1` is claimed by the eyebrow rule (see Eyebrow Labels exception above), leaving no inline-code slot for a subtitle. The subtitle on a `title` slide is therefore a plain paragraph placed immediately after the eyebrow: `h1 → p:has(> code:only-child) → p`. CSS on `section.title h1 + p:has(> code:only-child) + p` styles it as the subtitle (italic, `--on-dark-secondary`). No backticks, no `_em_`.

**What stays as `_em_`:** table footnotes and body prose that happens to be italic. These are not subtitles.

## State Convention

Two layouts — `verdict-grid` (T21) and `checklist` (T28) — accept **state markers** as a leading prefix on each list item. The marker syntax, color tokens, glyphs, and class names are unified across both so authors only learn one vocabulary.

**Authoring syntax:** `[x]`, `[~]`, or `[ ]` immediately after the bullet, followed by a space, followed by the label.

```markdown
- [x] Done — succeeded / chosen
- [~] Partial — caveat / partial success
- [ ] Todo — not done / rejected
```

**Canonical mapping:**

| Marker | Class       | Token   | Glyph       | Semantic                         |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `[x]`  | `state pass` | `--pass` | ✓ (green)   | succeeded, chosen, complete      |
| `[~]`  | `state warn` | `--warn` | ~ (amber)   | partial, caveat, qualified pass  |
| `[ ]`  | `state fail` | `--fail` | ✗ on `verdict-grid`, ☐ on `checklist` (red) | not done, rejected, todo |

**Why one convention covers both layouts:**

- `verdict-grid` evaluates options against criteria — every cell got a verdict, so `[ ]` reads as **rejected**.
- `checklist` reports completion — items either done, partial, or **not yet done**.

In both cases, `[ ]` signals "this did not pass." Red is the right color either way; the difference between "rejected" and "todo" comes from the layout's editorial framing, not from a separate token. This keeps a single mental model: green = good, amber = qualified, red = not.

**Glyphs differ by layout** because each picks the most readable shape for its content density: `verdict-grid` packs many states into a small chip row, so the binary ✗ is clearest; `checklist` gives each row full width, so the empty checkbox ☐ — which matches the markdown source `[ ]` literally — is more legible at body size.

**Theme tokens:**

| Token        | Indaco             | Cuoio                   | Use                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--pass`     | brand green deep   | deep green (`#2d6a3f`)  | success colour, foreground glyph + left bar    |
| `--warn`     | dark amber-brown   | warm amber (`#925c00`)  | partial / caveat colour                        |
| `--fail`     | deep red           | deep red (`#9b1c1c`)    | failed / rejected / todo colour                |
| `--pass-bg`  | 10% pass on bg     | 10% pass on bg          | row tint when authored as `[x]`                |
| `--warn-bg`  | 10% warn on bg     | 10% warn on bg          | row tint when authored as `[~]`                |
| `--fail-bg`  | 10% fail on bg     | 10% fail on bg          | row tint when authored as `[ ]`                |

All foreground tokens meet WCAG AA on body backgrounds. The `*-bg` variants are 10% colour-mix fills so the tint is visible without competing with body text.

**Implementation contract:** the marker is processed in three channels and they must stay in lockstep:

| Channel               | File                                | Function                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Marp build (HTML/PDF) | [marp.config.js](../../marp.config.js) | `verdictGridBadges`, `checklistItemStates` |
| Emulator (PDF direct) | [lattice-emulator.js](../../lattice-emulator.js) | `cls.includes('verdict-grid')`, `cls.includes('checklist')` |
| VS Code preview       | [lattice-runtime.js](../../lattice-runtime.js)   | `transformVerdictGridBadges`, `transformChecklistItemStates` |

Both layouts strip the marker and add `class="state pass|warn|fail"` to the carrier element (a `<span class="badge …">` for verdict-grid, the `<li>` itself for checklist). CSS owns all the visual chrome from there.

## Modifiers

Modifiers are class flags that compose with any layout. They encode **authorial intent** — density, emphasis, orientation — rather than cosmetic switches. Every modifier is opt-in and additive: an existing slide's rendering never changes until an author adds the modifier to its `_class` directive.

**Composition syntax:** layout first, then modifiers, space-separated:

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-grid compact dark -->
<!-- _class: closing accent -->
<!-- _class: list-steps phase -->
```

**Cascade rule:** when two modifiers tune the same variable (e.g. `compact loose`), the last one in the source wins. When modifiers tune disjoint properties (e.g. `compact dark`), they compose without conflict.

**Reference:** [2026-05-04-authoring-proposals.md §2 (modifier catalogue)](../notes/2026-05-04-authoring-proposals.md) and the appendix matrix at the end of that file enumerate which modifiers attach to which layouts.

### Cross-cutting modifiers

These modifiers apply across most layouts. They never change the layout's markdown contract — only how it renders.

#### `dark`

Reskins the slide canvas using the palette's `--dark-*` tokens. The same layout structure works on either canvas. The dark bookend layouts (`title`, `divider`, `closing`) include `dark` in their default chrome.

#### `compact`

Tightens the spacing scale ~25 % (`--sp-xs` … `--sp-2xl`). Card gaps, list gutters, and section LR padding follow because layouts read those variables via `var()`. The chrome reservation (top/bottom 88 px) is preserved so headers and footers never collide with content. Reach for `compact` when one more card needs to fit, or when prose runs the section by 1-2 lines.

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-grid compact -->
```

#### `loose`

Inverse of `compact` — grows the spacing scale ~25 %. Reach for it when a slide carries a single editorial point and you want the page to feel deliberately quiet.

```markdown
<!-- _class: content loose -->
```

#### `accent`

Replaces the default rainbow top-stripe with a solid accent-colour stripe and tints the slide heading. Composes with `dark`: on the dark canvas, where the spectrum stripe is suppressed, `accent.dark` restores a solid accent stripe so the visual signal still reads.

```markdown
<!-- _class: closing accent -->
```

#### `mirror`

Flips the asymmetric half of a layout left/right. Applies only where the layout has an inherent left/right asymmetry — symmetric grids ignore it.

| Layout          | Effect                                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image`         | image side flips from right (default) to left. Alias of legacy `left`. |
| `featured`      | hero card moves from the left column to the right column.              |
| `split-panel`   | accent panel moves from the left to the right.                         |
| `compare-prose` | left and right cards swap; chosen/decision read from the left.         |

```markdown
<!-- _class: image mirror -->
<!-- _class: featured mirror -->
<!-- _class: compare-prose mirror chosen -->
```

`image left` is preserved as a deprecated alias; new authoring should prefer `image mirror`.

#### `numbered`

Stamps an auto-incrementing index in the top-right corner of bookend slides. Each layout (`divider`, `subtopic`, `closing`) carries its own counter, so a `divider numbered` series and a `closing numbered` series number independently.

| Layout     | Counter token   | Stamp position |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| `divider`  | `lat-divider`   | top-right      |
| `subtopic` | `lat-subtopic`  | top-right      |
| `closing`  | `lat-closing`   | top-right      |

```markdown
<!-- _class: divider numbered -->   → first stamps "01", next "02", …
<!-- _class: closing numbered -->   → independent counter, starts at "01"
```

The counter is set on `body` and walks the deck once. Authors do not number sections manually — the layout does it.

### Layout-specific modifiers

#### `list-steps` family

Eight modifiers tune the step badge and the strip orientation. They compose along two independent axes — **prefix word** and **counter format** — plus an orthogonal **orientation** flag.

| Modifier    | Effect                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `phase`     | badge prefix becomes `PHASE 01`, `PHASE 02`, …               |
| `stage`     | badge prefix becomes `STAGE 01`, `STAGE 02`, …               |
| `milestone` | badge prefix becomes `MILESTONE 01`, …                       |
| `rank`      | badge prefix becomes `RANK 01`, …                            |
| `tier`      | badge prefix becomes `TIER 01`, …                            |
| `lettered`  | counter format becomes `A`, `B`, `C` (composes with prefix)  |
| `roman`     | counter format becomes `I`, `II`, `III` (composes with prefix) |
| `vertical`  | strip orientation flips column → row; arrow becomes down-arrow |

Default prefix is `STEP`; default format is decimal-leading-zero (`01`, `02`, …). Examples:

```markdown
<!-- _class: list-steps phase -->            → PHASE 01, PHASE 02, PHASE 03
<!-- _class: list-steps milestone lettered -->→ MILESTONE A, MILESTONE B, MILESTONE C
<!-- _class: list-steps tier roman -->        → TIER I, TIER II, TIER III
<!-- _class: list-steps vertical compact -->  → vertical strip with compact spacing
```

The vertical orientation pairs well with `compact` for 3-step decks where each step needs body-paragraph room.

#### `compare-prose` family

Four modifiers name the editorial intent of a two-card comparison. The post-processor always emits left-then-right; authors put the option considered first and the choice second.

| Modifier   | Effect                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chosen`   | right card is the winner — accent left-edge, accent-tinted background, accent title.                   |
| `rejected` | right card is the option dropped — title struck-through, body muted.                                    |
| `decision` | composes both: left card de-emphasised, right card emphasised, connector amplified and labelled `DECISION`. |
| `vertical` | stack the two cards vertically; arrow connector rotates 90°. For long-body comparisons.                 |

```markdown
<!-- _class: compare-prose chosen -->     → right card emphasised
<!-- _class: compare-prose decision -->   → left struck through, right emphasised, arrow labelled
<!-- _class: compare-prose vertical -->   → cards stacked, arrow rotated
```

`decision` is the most common variant in real decks — it names the "considered then chose" pattern directly.

#### `cards-grid` shape modifiers

Two modifiers tune the column count. Default is two columns.

| Modifier | Effect                                                                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `three`  | three equal columns instead of two. The 2+1 last-child span rule is reset to `auto`.           |
| `four`   | four equal columns instead of two. Pair with `compact` so the cards retain breathing room.     |

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-grid three -->            → three equal columns
<!-- _class: cards-grid four compact -->     → four columns, tightened spacing
```

#### `cards-stack horizontal`

Flips the stack direction from vertical (cards as rows) to horizontal (cards as a row of columns). Use when the cards are short claims that read left-to-right and the audience scans across rather than down.

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-stack horizontal -->
```

## New Layouts

Four authoring components introduced to replace the most common `cards-grid` / `compare-prose` hand-rolls in real decks. All four are CSS-only; their markdown contracts are simple list shapes Marp emits natively.

**Reference:** [2026-05-04-authoring-proposals.md §3.1–3.6](../notes/2026-05-04-authoring-proposals.md).

### `matrix-2x2` — quadrant grid

Used for SWOT, Eisenhower, BCG growth-share, risk × impact, build-vs-buy. Four top-level items in declaration order map to **top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right**. The fourth (bottom-right) cell carries an accent ring as the conventional "outcome" or "high-priority" cell.

```markdown
<!-- _class: matrix-2x2 -->

## How we sort vendors against our two axes.

`Coverage · Cost`

- High coverage / Low cost
  - body for the TL cell
- High coverage / High cost
  - body for the TR cell
- Low coverage / Low cost
  - body for the BL cell
- Low coverage / High cost
  - body for the BR cell (accent)
```

### `decision` — the verdict slide

Heavier than `closing`, lighter than `featured`. The heading carries the verdict verb in display weight; 2–4 short justifications below render as a horizontal strip with an accent left edge.

```markdown
<!-- _class: decision -->

## We are building, not buying.

`Decision · 2026 Q1`

- **Build**
  - Owns the architecture, owns the operating model, owns the timeline.
- **Why not buy**
  - Three vendors evaluated; none cover the regulatory boundary in-process.
- **Why not delay**
  - The compliance window closes in 18 months.
```

### `before-after` — explicit state-change

Two cards with a large arrow between. The right (After) card carries an accent ring to signal the new state. An optional trailing paragraph renders as a context note below the comparison.

```markdown
<!-- _class: before-after -->

## Detokenize used to require a vault round-trip.

`Latency story · before vs after`

- **Before**
  - Body explaining the prior state.
- **After**
  - Body explaining the new state.

Optional context sentence below the comparison.
```

### `principles` — declared statements

Numbered list of declarative one-liners in display weight. Each item is one paragraph (no nested body). Generous line-height; the leading counter renders in accent mono.

| Modifier   | Effect                                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| (default)  | counter shows `01`, `02`, `03` (decimal-leading-zero) |
| `lettered` | counter shows `A`, `B`, `C`                           |
| `roman`    | counter shows `I`, `II`, `III`                        |
| `bullet`   | suppresses the counter; renders a middot prefix       |

```markdown
<!-- _class: principles -->

## How we make calls when the spec is silent.

1. We default to the choice that is cheaper to reverse.
2. We name the actor, never the system.
3. We write down the bet on the same slide as the choice.
```

### `roadmap` — phased multi-workstream grid

A markdown table that becomes a phased rollout grid. The first column carries the workstream label (sticky, bold, on tinted ground). Phase columns (everything after the first) get phase chrome — a numbered badge in the header. Empty cells render as a thin muted dash so the eye reads "not in this phase" rather than "missing data."

```markdown
<!-- _class: roadmap -->

## What ships in each phase, by workstream.

| Workstream | Phase 01         | Phase 02           | Phase 03              |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Platform   | Codebook signing | Multi-tenant DEKs  | Per-purpose codebooks |
| Operations | Manual rotation  | Automated rotation | Crypto-shred          |
| SDK        | Java             |                    | Polyglot parity       |
```

### `kpi` — metrics dashboard with targets and trends

Ordered or unordered list. Each item is a card: bold = the metric (display weight), first nested bullet = the label, optional second nested bullet = the target/trend sub-line. Cards lay out in an auto-fit grid (3-4 across at standard widths, wraps to a second row beyond that). Each card carries a categorical top-stripe rotating through the `--cat-*` palette.

| Modifier  | Effect                                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| (default) | sub-line renders in muted body colour                                          |

### `agenda` — auto-numbered table of contents

Ordered list of section titles, optionally followed by a page reference (` — page N`). Counter renders in accent mono; rows are separated by hairline rules.

| Modifier      | Effect                                                                      |

| (default)     | all rows render at full opacity                                             |
| `progress-N`  | highlights the Nth row as "you are here"; rows above render muted, rows below render normal (N = 1-9) |

```markdown
<!-- _class: agenda progress-2 -->

## What this deck covers, in order.

1. The Design — page 7
2. The Phasing — page 18
3. The Choices — page 26
4. Closing — page 64
```

### `actors` — roster of responsibilities owned by named actors

Unordered list. Each item: bold = the responsibility / capability (left header), inline-code = the actor name (rendered as a filled accent pill, right-aligned), nested list line = the body. Bold-is-primary / code-is-chip is the consistent Lattice authoring convention.

```markdown
<!-- _class: actors -->

## Who owns each part of the codebook lifecycle.

- **Key custody** `HSM admin`
  - Manages KEK ceremonies and rotation. Never holds plaintext DEKs.
- **Policy** `Platform operator`
  - Owns codebook policy, signing keys, version floors, and revocation playbooks.
- **Oversight** `Examiner`
  - Reads the HSM audit trail; cannot read plaintext.
```

### `tldr` — single-line takeaways / recap

Unordered or ordered list of one-line takeaways. Optionally end each line with a `→ slide N` reference. Use as an executive summary or a section recap.

| Modifier   | Effect                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| (default)  | plain takeaways with hairline separators                |
| `numbered` | adds a `01.`, `02.` accent mono prefix to each line     |

```markdown
<!-- _class: tldr numbered -->

## What this section will tell you, in five lines.

- The codebook model gets in-process latency with vault-grade key custody. → slide 8
- Rotation is a version-floor increment, not a coordinated cutover. → slide 12
- Per-tenant KEKs make crypto-shred a single HSM op. → slide 18
```

## Template 1: Title (dark bookend)

```text

```

**CSS class:** `title`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: title -->
<!-- _paginate: false -->
<!-- _header: '' -->
<!-- _footer: '' -->
```

- Background: `--bg-dark`
- Centered vertically and horizontally
- Eyebrow: 11px mono, letter-spaced, `--text-muted`
- Title: 54-72px display font, `--text-display`
- Accent line: 60px wide, 1px, `--accent`
- Subtitle: 16px body font, `--text-muted`
- No header, footer, or page number

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
# Slide Title Here

`Eyebrow Label · Optional`

Subtitle or tagline — plain paragraph, italic, muted.
```

- `h1` = title (large, display font) — **first element** to satisfy MD041
- `` `inline code` `` paragraph after `h1` = eyebrow (mono uppercase, faint) — CSS on `section.title h1 + p:has(> code:only-child)` overrides the normal subtitle rule
- plain `p` after the eyebrow = subtitle (italic, `--on-dark-secondary`) — CSS on `section.title h1 + p:has(> code:only-child) + p`
- Eyebrow and subtitle are both optional; omit either or both if not needed

## Template 2: Section Divider

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**CSS class:** `divider`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: divider -->
<!-- _paginate: false -->
<!-- _header: '' -->
<!-- _footer: '' -->
```

- Background: `--bg-dark` or accent-tinted
- Strong visual signal: large section number (40-60px) in bordered box, or accent-colored left bar, or full background color change
- Section label: 11px, uppercase, letter-spaced
- Title: 48px (`--fs-3xl`) display font, `--text-display`
- Must be visually distinct from content slides — dividers should jump out when flipping through
- No header, footer, or page number

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
`Section 01 · Foundations`

# Section Title Goes Here
```

- `` `inline code` `` = eyebrow label (faint, uppercase, top)
- `h1` = section title (large, display font)

## Template 3: Sub-Topic

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `subtopic`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: subtopic -->
```

- Background: `--bg` (light — same as content slides)
- Centered vertically and horizontally
- Lighter than a divider — orients, doesn't announce
- Eyebrow: 11px, `--text-muted`
- Title: 48px (`--fs-3xl`), `--text-heading`
- Description: 16-18px, `--text-body`; use `_em_` for the italic subtitle; 1-2 sentences max
- Header, footer, and page number visible

## Template 4: Content (text only)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `diagram`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: diagram -->
```

- Background: slightly different from `--bg` (use `--bg-alt` or warm-white) so diagram container stands out
- Title + subtitle above the container
- Diagram inside rounded-corner card (`--bg`, `--border`)
- Diagram occupies ~60-70% of slide area
- Container: 24-32px internal padding

## Template 6: Stats / KPI Row

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `stats`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: stats -->
```

- Stat numbers: 52px (`--fs-stat`), body font (Outfit), `--accent`
- Stat labels: 13px (`--fs-label`), uppercase, letter-spaced, `--text-label`
- 3-5 stats in a horizontal row, evenly spaced
- Description above: 16px, italic, `--text-label`

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
`Impact · Pilot Results`

## Six months of results across four product teams.

`Measured against pre-framework baseline.`

1. **73%** faster close
2. **4.2×** signal recall
3. **18** decisions logged
4. **91%** team alignment
```

- `` `inline code` `` paragraph above `h2` = eyebrow
- `h2` = heading
- `` `inline code` `` paragraph after `h2` = italic subtitle, centered below heading
- `ol > li`: `**number**` = stat value; remaining text = label

## Template 7: Card Grid (2×2)

```text

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `cards-grid`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-grid -->
```

**Markdown format** — nested list, card header is auto-bolded by CSS:

```markdown
- Card Title
  - Body text for this card.
- Another Title
  - Body text for the second card.
```

Outer list may be `ul` (`-`) or `ol` (`1.`). Sublist may also be `ul` or `ol`.

> **Indentation rule:** When using `ol`, the sublist must be indented **3 spaces** (to clear the `1. ` prefix). 2 spaces breaks the nesting — Markdown treats it as a sibling list, not a child list.
>
> ```markdown
> 1. Card Title
>    - Body text. ← 3 spaces ✓
> ```

- 2×2 grid with 24px (`--sp-md`) gaps
- Cards: `--bg-alt` fill, `--border` border, `--radius-md` corner radius
- Card header: 18px (`--fs-md`) bold, `--text-heading` — auto-bolded by CSS, no `**...**` needed
- Card body (nested list): 16px (`--fs-body`), `--text-body`
- Equal-width, equal-height cards; last odd card spans full width automatically
- **Numbered cards** (`ol` source): flush top-left corner badge — accent background, white mono number, `--radius-md 0 --radius-sm 0` corners; card `padding-top` is automatically increased to clear the badge
- Trailing `> blockquote` on this layout renders as a **Key Insight** panel (see Key Insight feature below)

**Inline code in card headers and body text:**

Inline `` `code` `` spans render correctly in both card title lines and body text with no special wrapper required.

**Card header (title line)** — Write inline code directly after the title text:

```markdown
- Signal Intake `v2.4`
  - Body text.
- Scoring Model `configurable`
  - Body text.
```

Visual result: bold card title on the left, compact pill badge right-aligned on the same row. The badge uses `--text-body` color, `--text-muted` border, and `--bg` background (matching verdict-grid pill style) — distinct from the accent-colored body code. Body text spans full card width below.

> **How it works**: The card `<li>` uses `grid-template-columns: 1fr auto`. Marp's Chromium rendering places the title text node in column 1 (`1fr`) and the `<code>` element is explicitly pinned to `grid-column:2; grid-row:1` via CSS, keeping them on the same visual row despite Chromium's anonymous block box behavior in SVG foreignObject context. The body `<ul>` carries `grid-column: 1 / -1` so it spans the full card width on the next row.

> **Backwards compat**: `**Title `code`**` (bold wrapper) still works — `<strong>` becomes a single block grid item spanning both columns, with text and code flowing inline inside it.

**Card body text** — Code placed within body bullet text renders **inline** within the prose without any special wrapper:

```markdown
- Card Title
  - Average latency: `4 min` from ingestion to scored entry.
  - Every prioritization change above `P2` must carry a rationale.
```

Visual result: accent-colored monospace pill appearing inline within the sentence.

> **Do not use inline code as a standalone line inside a card body** — a body bullet that contains only `` `code` `` and nothing else will be promoted to an eyebrow label by the subtitle/eyebrow rules. Mix it with surrounding prose.

## Template 8: Card Grid 2+1

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  footer                           1/19  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `cards-grid`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-grid -->
```

**Markdown format** — same nested list format as `cards-grid`, exactly 3 items:

```markdown
- Card Title
  - Body text.
```

- Top row: two equal cards, 24px gap — automatic from 2-column grid
- Bottom row: one card spanning full width — automatic (`li:last-child:nth-child(odd)` rule)
- Bottom card for summary, conclusion, or key takeaway
- Same card styling as 2×2
- **No separate class needed** — `cards-grid` handles 2, 3, and 4 items automatically

## Template 9: Two Cards Stacked (vertical)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  header                                 │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `cards-stack`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-stack -->
```

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-stack -->

## Two failure modes the framework is designed to prevent.

- **False signal amplification.** A single loud voice — one enterprise customer, one analyst report — dominates the decision without being weighed against the full signal set.
- **Signal hoarding.** Teams collect signals but do not log decisions, so the calibration loop has nothing to learn from.
```

- `h2` = heading
- Flat `ul`/`ol` — each top-level `li` becomes a card
- **Inline title contract:** `**Title.**` (bold, period-terminated) at the start of the `li` reads as the card title; body prose continues on the same line. Distinct from `cards-grid` where the title sits on its own line above a nested body list.
- Two full-width cards stacked vertically
- 16px gap between cards
- Each card takes roughly equal vertical space
- Sequential relationship: top leads to bottom
- Good for problem/solution, setup/payoff, context/detail

## Template 10: Two Cards Side-by-Side (horizontal)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `cards-side`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-side -->
```

**Markdown format** — same nested list format as `cards-grid` (auto-bold, no `**...**` required):

```markdown
- Card Title
  - Body text.
```

- Two equal cards side by side
- 24px gap between cards
- Each card takes roughly equal width and full available height
- Parallel relationship: two topics shown together
- No connector or arrow — use Template 12 if you need one
- Good for two categories, two approaches, two perspectives

## Template 11: Comparison (side by side with connector)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**CSS class:** `compare-prose`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: compare-prose -->
```

**Markdown format** — same nested list format as `cards-grid`, exactly 2 items (auto-bold, no `**...**` required):

```markdown
- Before / Option A
  - Body text describing this side.
- After / Option B
  - Body text describing this side.
```

- Same physical layout as Template 11 but with visual connector (`❯` chevron) centered between cards
- Implies transformation, contrast, or choice
- Connector: `❯` at 30px (`--fs-xl`), `--text-muted`
- Cards are equal width
- Card header: 18px (`--fs-md`) bold, `--text-heading` — auto-bolded by CSS
- Card body (nested list): 16px (`--fs-body`), `--text-body`

**CSS class:** `timeline`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: timeline -->
```

- Horizontal line with colored dots
- Use `ol` for numbered sequential steps (circles show 1, 2, 3…)
- Use `ul` for non-sequential milestones (plain dot circles)
- Each item: label on its own line, then `- description` as nested list (italic is optional but common)
- 3–6 steps maximum
- Example authoring:

```markdown
1. Signal Logged
   - Owner classifies and submits to intake queue
2. Scored
   - Model applies current weights, generates score
```

## Template 14: List / Bullet Points

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `list`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: list -->
```

- Items render as card-like rows: `--bg-alt` fill, `--border` border, 3px `--accent` left bar, `--radius-md` corners — not plain text bullets
- Heading: 36px (`--fs-2xl`), `--text-heading`
- Item text: 18px (`--fs-md`), `--text-body`, `--lh-base`
- 4-6 items maximum
- Optional nested `- sub-description` under each item renders in smaller muted text
- **`ol` variant**: items get a leading-zero counter (`01`, `02`…) in `--accent` mono, rendered as a grid row — use when order matters

**Marp markdown source (ul):**

```markdown
- First point clearly stated.
- Second point with enough room.
- Third point, well spaced.
```

**Marp markdown source (ol, numbered):**

```markdown
1. You have a regular prioritization cadence.
2. At least one person owns signal collection.
3. Leadership has agreed to log decisions.
```

## Template 15: Image Full

One class, two authoring modes — caption is optional.

### Without caption

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**CSS class:** `image-full`

**Without caption:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: image-full -->
<!-- _paginate: false -->

## [ Placeholder text shown in draft mode ]
```

**With caption:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: image-full -->
<!-- _paginate: false -->

## [ Placeholder text shown in draft mode ]

Caption text that appears as an overlay bar at the bottom.
```

- Caption bar is controlled by a trailing paragraph — include it or omit it
- The `## heading` text is the draft placeholder; replaced by the real image at `![bg](url)`
- `footer` is hidden — use the trailing paragraph for attribution instead
- Use for product screenshots, reference images, full-canvas visuals

## Template 16: Big Number / Single Stat

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `big-number`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: big-number -->
```

- Centered vertically and horizontally
- Number: 80-120px, display font, `--accent`
- Label above: 11px, `--text-muted`, uppercase
- Description below: 16-18px, `--text-body`, 1-2 sentences
- The number IS the slide — everything else supports it
- Authoring: nested list — `- 14×` then `  - description`

**Example:**

```markdown
`Eyebrow Label`

- 14×
  - Return on signal investment — one or two sentences of context.
```

## Template 17: Split Panel (colored sidebar)

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `split-panel`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: split-panel -->
```

- Left panel: 34% width, full-height accent color background
- Right panel: 66% width, `--bg`
- Left panel contains: inline-code eyebrow paragraph centered between the title (h2, bottom) and the top of the panel — use `` `Section Label` `` placed **between `h2` and `h3`** in the source. The CSS routes it to the left panel automatically.
- Right panel contains: `h3` subheading, optional `p` intro, then `ul`/`ol` card tiles
- Good for category-based slides where sidebar signals section or dimension
- **Card headers**: auto-bolded by CSS, no `**...**` required
- Supports both `ul` (no badge) and `ol` (flush top-left corner badge)
- **Authoring pattern:**

```markdown
## Slide Title

`Section Label`

### Section heading

Optional intro paragraph.

1. Card Title
   - Card body — description or supporting detail.
2. Card Title
   - Card body.
```

- `` `inline code` `` paragraph = left panel eyebrow (mono uppercase, faint, centered)
- `h2` = left panel title (white, bottom)
- `h3` = right panel subheading
- `p` = right panel intro text
- `ol > li` = stacked card tiles with flush corner badge; `ul > li` = stacked card tiles without badge
- **Optional metadata footer** = a trailing `ul` placed *after* the main `ol`/`ul`. Renders pinned to the bottom of the right panel with a divider line above. Authored as `**Label** · body` items — typical use: audience, intent, scope, or other framing labels. Absent → panel renders as before.

## Template 18: Closing (dark bookend)

```

**CSS class:** `closing`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: closing -->
<!-- _paginate: false -->
<!-- _header: '' -->
<!-- _footer: '' -->
```

- Mirrors title slide structure
- Background: `--bg-dark`
- Statement (`p` below the heading): 16px (`--fs-body`) italic, `--on-dark-secondary`
- Heading (`h2`): 48px display font, `--text-display`
- No header, footer, or page number

## Template 19: Three-Row Wide Cards

```

**CSS class:** `cards-wide`

**Layout spec:**

- `section.cards-wide`: flex column, 48px 64px padding
- Cards container: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 12px; flex: 1`
- Each card: `flex: 1; background: var(--bg-alt); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: --radius-md; padding: --sp-sm --sp-md; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: --sp-xs`
- Card header row: bare heading text (the part of the `<li>` before the nested bullet), auto-bolded by CSS, with inline numbered badge before it
  - Badge: `content: counter(wide-counter)` — mono pill, 16px, accent background, white text
  - Title: 16px (`--fs-body`) bold, `--text-heading`
- Card body (`ul > li`): 15px (`--fs-sm`), `--text-body`, full width
- Note: write the heading as plain text — no `**…**` needed. The layout bolds the entire `<li>` flow and resets the nested `<ul>` to body weight. Wrapping the heading in `**…**` is harmless but redundant.

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-wide -->

## Three scoring failure modes found in the pilot.

1. Recency dominance
   - High-recency noise crowding out durable signal. Teams set recency weight above 50% without empirical backing.
2. Source concentration
   - Single-customer signals inflating confidence scores. One vocal customer is not a market signal.
3. Outcome misclassification
   - PMs logging predicted outcomes that were too vague to score. Ambiguous outcomes cannot be calibrated.
```

**How the renderer maps this:**

- Each `1. Title` → one wide card; the numbered badge (1, 2, 3…) is auto-generated by CSS counter on `li::before`
- The bare heading text on the `1.` line → card header (auto-bolded, with inline badge); no `**…**` required
- Nested `- body` → card body text (auto-reset to body weight and colour)

**When to use:** Three parallel items that each need a title and a sentence of body context — three risks, three failure modes, three design constraints. Not for three items that fit as bullets (use T14) or three items that need comparison (use T22).

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `list-criteria`

**Layout spec:**

- `section.list-criteria`: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding: 48px 64px`
- Slide heading (`h2`): 32-36px, `margin-bottom: 32px`
- Items list: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 24px; flex: 1; justify-content: center`
- Each item: `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 72px 1fr; align-items: start; gap: 0`
- Number cell: `font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: 40-48px; font-weight: 700; color: var(--accent); line-height: 1; padding-right: 24px`
- Text cell: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 4px; padding-top: 6px` (nudge down to align with top of number)
  - Item title: `font-size: 17-19px; font-weight: 700; color: var(--text-heading)`
  - Item description: `font-size: 14-16px; color: var(--text-body); line-height: 1.6`
- Optional: thin `border-top: 1px solid var(--border)` above each item except the first
- Numbers are display elements — do not use `<ol>` list semantics; build with `<div>` grid rows
- 3-5 items maximum — if more, split across two slides

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: list-criteria -->

## Four requirements every decision system must meet.

- Speed
  - Decisions must close within the window they are relevant to. Systems that add latency consume the value they exist to protect.
- Auditability
  - Every prioritization decision above a threshold must carry a traceable rationale. Required for alignment and compliance.
- Adoption
  - If the team won’t use it weekly, calibration never runs and the model never improves.
- Calibration
  - The system must improve over time. A static scoring model is a spreadsheet with extra steps.
```

**How the renderer maps this:**

- The sequence number (01, 02…) is auto-generated by CSS counter — do not author it in the Markdown
- Each `- Title` → one criteria row; the heading is auto-bolded by CSS, no `**…**` required (`**…**` is harmless if you prefer it)
- Nested `- description` → supporting text, 16px (`--fs-body`), `--text-body`
- 3–5 items maximum; if more, split across two slides

**When to use:** Ranked criteria, leadership principles, non-negotiable requirements, or any list where the items carry enough weight that a bullet point understates them. The number is a visual anchor, not a rank signal — reordering is fine.

**CSS class:** `verdict-grid` (extends standard card grid)

**Layout spec:**

- Grid layout: identical to Template 8 (2×2, `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 16px`)
- Each card: `background: var(--bg-alt); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: 12px; padding: 20px 24px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px`
- Card title: `font-size: 15-17px; font-weight: 700; color: var(--text-heading)`
- Badge row: `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 6px`
- Each badge: `display: inline-flex; align-items: center; gap: 4px; font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: 11px; font-weight: 600; border-radius: 999px; padding: 3px 8px`
- Badge color variants — define these CSS classes:
  - `.badge-pass`: `background: rgba(45,106,63,0.12); color: #2d6a3f`
  - `.badge-fail`: `background: rgba(155,28,28,0.12); color: #9b1c1c`
  - `.badge-warn`: `background: rgba(146,100,0,0.12); color: #925c00`
- Preferred card modifier `.card-preferred`:
  - `background: var(--accent-soft)` (or a light tint of `--accent` at 8-12% opacity)
  - `border-color: var(--accent)`
  - Card title: `color: var(--accent)`
- All four cards remain equal size — the highlight is color only, not size change

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: verdict-grid -->

## We have four options, and they are not equally viable.

- Option 1 · Label
  - [x] In-process
  - [~] Independence
  - [x] Ops
  - [] Availability
  - The architectural model leadership wants, but the stand-up burden is prohibitive.
- Option 2 · Label
  - [ ] In-process
  - [ ] Independence
  - [x] Ops
  - [x] Availability
  - Consumed as delivered. Criterion relaxed is availability coupling.
- Option 3 · Label
  - [x] In-process
  - [x] Independence
  - [ ] Ops
  - [x] Availability
  - Honors architecture and independence, at the cost of a dedicated platform capability.
- Option 4 · Label
  - [x] In-process
  - [~] Independence
  - [x] Ops
  - [x] Availability
  - Co-develop the architecture needed. Same vendor, different engagement model.
```

- Each `- Card Title` → one card in the grid; the heading is auto-bolded by CSS, no `**…**` required (`**…**` is harmless if you prefer it)
- `[x]` → pass badge (green); `[ ]` → fail badge (red); `[~]` → warn badge (amber)
- **Badge colors (green/red/amber) render only in the Marp CLI / lattice-emulator.js path.** The VS Code preview shows all badges as neutral pills (`--bg` fill, `--text-muted` border).
- Last nested `li` (after all badge items) → card body description
- Last card in the grid gets accent-soft highlight automatically (`li:last-child` rule)

**When to use:** Option comparison, vendor evaluation, feature matrix where a recommended choice must be visible without hiding the tradeoffs. The badges let a reader scan all cards at once before reading any body text.

## Template 22: Comparison Table

```

**CSS class:** `compare-table`

**Layout spec:**

- `section.compare-table`: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding: 48px 64px`
- Slide heading (`h2`): 28-34px, `margin-bottom: 20px`
- Table wrapper: `flex: 1; overflow: hidden`
- `table`: `width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13-15px`
- Header row chrome (`thead tr`): `background: var(--spectrum) bottom / 100% 2px no-repeat` — the spectrum-gradient separator replaces a flat fill + border with the same brand chrome used by glossary, roadmap, and the slide top stripe
- Header cells (`thead th`): `font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: 11px; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: 0.10em; text-transform: uppercase; color: var(--text-label); padding: 8px 16px 10px; text-align: left`
- First column (row labels, `td:first-child`): `font-weight: 600; color: var(--text-heading); width: 28%; padding: 10px 16px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border)`
- Data cells (`td`): `padding: 10px 16px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border); color: var(--text-body)`
- Cell semantic tinting — apply via class on `<td>`:
  - `.cell-pass`: `background: rgba(45,106,63,0.08); color: #2d6a3f`
  - `.cell-fail`: `background: rgba(155,28,28,0.08); color: #9b1c1c`
  - `.cell-warn`: `background: rgba(146,100,0,0.08); color: #925c00`
  - No class: neutral, `color: var(--text-muted)`
- Use background tint only — never bold fills that obscure text
- Trailing paragraph after the table follows the universal trailing-paragraph registers (see Feature: Below-Note and Feature: Annotation): a plain trailing `<p>` renders as a hairline-ruled below-note, and a trailing `<p>` whose only content is `_italic_` markdown renders as an annotation with the `✦` glyph. There is no `compare-table`-specific footnote rule.
- Maximum ~6 rows, ~5 columns before legibility breaks — split or simplify if more

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: compare-table -->

## Here are the numbers side by side.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Option A</th>
      <th>Option B</th>
      <th>Option C</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Runtime model</td>
      <td class="cell-pass">In-process</td>
      <td class="cell-fail">Out-of-process</td>
      <td class="cell-pass">In-process</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Availability coupling</td>
      <td class="cell-pass">Contained</td>
      <td class="cell-fail">Every app ≤ vendor</td>
      <td class="cell-pass">Contained</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Operational burden</td>
      <td class="cell-fail">Heavy</td>
      <td>Vendor-managed</td>
      <td class="cell-warn">Shared</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

_Scope and timeline estimates are not included — this table covers architectural properties only._
```

**Note:** This template requires `html: true` in the Marp frontmatter. The `<table>` is written directly in the markdown — Marp passes it through when HTML is enabled. Cell classes (`.cell-pass`, `.cell-fail`, `.cell-warn`) must be defined in the deck's CSS theme.

**Note on the trailing line:** the example uses an italic-only paragraph, which the universal annotation register renders with the `✦` glyph + label-size muted text. Drop the italics to get a below-note instead (full-width hairline rule + body text). Drop the line entirely if no scope-caveat is needed.

**When to use:** Multi-vendor comparison, criteria matrix, architectural property grid. Use when the reader needs to scan both across a row (how one item compares across options) and down a column (what one option looks like in total). If you only need to compare two things, use T11 instead.

## Template 23: Featured Card + Sub-Grid

```

**CSS class:** `featured`

**Layout spec:**

- `section.featured`: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding: 48px 64px`
- Slide heading (`h2`): 28-34px, `margin-bottom: 20px`
- Featured card: `background: var(--accent-soft); border: 1px solid var(--accent); border-radius: 12px; padding: 24px 28px; margin-bottom: 20px`
  - Featured label: `font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: 11px; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: 0.08em; text-transform: uppercase; color: var(--accent); margin-bottom: 12px` — prepend a short rule: use CSS `::before { content: '── '; }` or a `<span class="rule">── </span>`
  - Featured body: `font-size: 17-20px; color: var(--text-body); line-height: 1.7; max 2-3 sentences`
- Sub-card row: `display: flex; gap: 16px`
  - Each sub-card: `flex: 1; background: var(--bg-alt); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: 12px; padding: 20px 24px`
  - Sub-card title: `font-size: 15-16px; font-weight: 700; color: var(--accent)` (accent, not heading — signals it's subordinate to the featured label but still active)
  - Sub-card body: `font-size: 14px; color: var(--text-body); line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 8px`
- Hierarchy rule: featured card is larger, warmer, and has accent border — sub-cards are neutral. Never make all three areas equal weight.

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: featured -->

## Applying the criteria, here is where the evidence points.

- The evidence favors this approach
  - Featured card body — the assertion the slide makes. Two to three sentences maximum.
- The path is not self-executing
  - First qualification or condition that the reader needs to act on.
- Option B is the right fallback
  - Second qualification or fallback condition.
```

**How the renderer maps this:**

- First top-level `li` → featured card (accent-soft background, accent border); card title is auto-bolded by CSS
- Remaining `li` items → sub-card row (equal width); sub-card titles also auto-bolded by CSS
- No `**...**` required — all card headers are auto-bolded
- Nested `ul/ol > li` → card body text

**When to use:** Assessment with a clear recommended direction plus qualifications or fallback conditions. This template asserts a direction — do not use it for three equal options (use T7 or T21). Use it when the deck needs to say "here is the answer, and here is the nuance."

## Feature: Key Insight Panel

Any card-bearing layout that ends with a trailing `> blockquote` renders it as a **Key Insight panel** — an accent-tinted bar that pins below the card content.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  header                                 │
│  LABEL                                  │
│  Grid Title                             │
│                                         │
│   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   │
│   │ Card Title 1 │   │ Card Title 2 │   │
│   │ body text    │   │ body text    │   │
│   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   │
│   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐   │
│   │ KEY INSIGHT                     │   │
│   │ The key insight text here.      │   │
│   └─────────────────────────────────┘   │
│  footer                           1/19  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Layouts that support Key Insight:** every layout except `quote` and `featured` (which use the blockquote slot for primary content). In practice, reach for it on card- and list-bearing layouts where the trailing blockquote summarises the slide.

**Styling:**

- Panel: `--accent-soft` background, `1px solid var(--accent)` border, `--radius-md` corners
- "KEY INSIGHT" eyebrow: 13px (`--fs-label`) mono, bold, letter-spaced, `--accent` color
- Body text: 16px (`--fs-body`) body font, `--text-heading` color, not italic

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-grid -->

## Slide heading.

- Card Title 1
  - Card body.
- Card Title 2
  - Card body.

> The key insight text that ties the cards together. One sentence preferred.
```

**Note:** The blockquote must be the **last element** on the slide (or the last element before a trailing paragraph).

## Feature: Below-Note

A trailing plain paragraph (not a blockquote) on any card-bearing layout renders as a **below-note** — body-sized contextual text with a hairline gradient rule above it, visually separate from the card content.

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-grid -->

## Slide heading.

- Card Title 1
  - Card body.
- Card Title 2
  - Card body.

This is a below-note. It appears below the cards with a hairline rule above it.
```

**Layouts that support below-note:** `cards-grid`, `cards-stack`, `cards-wide`, `compare-prose`, `compare-table`, `verdict-grid`, `featured`, `list`, `list-criteria`, `list-steps`, `list-tabular`, `timeline`, `principles`, `tldr`, `matrix-2x2`, `decision`, `before-after`, `actors`, `kpi`, `agenda`

- Rule: hairline gradient from `--accent` to transparent
- Text: 16px (`--fs-body`), `--text-body`
- Use for source attribution, scope caveats, or a single sentence of additional context

---

## Feature: Annotation

A trailing paragraph whose only content is an `_italic_` span renders as an **annotation** — a `✦` (U+2726) glyph in `--accent` followed by smaller, muted, label-size text. No hairline rule. Distinct from a below-note: lighter visual weight, lower information density, signals "this is a footnote, not a continuation of the argument."

```markdown
<!-- _class: cards-grid -->

## Slide heading.

- Card Title 1
  - Card body.
- Card Title 2
  - Card body.

_Source: pilot retrospective, six months across four product teams._
```

**Layouts that support annotation:** same set as below-note — `cards-grid`, `cards-stack`, `cards-wide`, `compare-prose`, `compare-table`, `verdict-grid`, `featured`, `list`, `list-criteria`, `list-steps`, `list-tabular`, `timeline`, `principles`, `tldr`, `matrix-2x2`, `decision`, `before-after`, `actors`, `kpi`, `agenda`

- Selector: `p:has(> em:only-child)` — the paragraph must contain a single `<em>` and nothing else (no leading/trailing text outside the italic span)
- Glyph: `✦` (U+2726) in `--accent`, `0.95em`
- Text: 15px (`--fs-sm`), `--text-muted`
- Use for: source citations, scope caveats, asterisk-style footnotes — content that frames the slide rather than extending its argument

**Note:** The three trailing-paragraph registers compose by markdown shape on the same set of layouts:

| Markdown shape                          | Renders as       | Visual                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `> blockquote`                          | **Key Insight**  | accent-tinted panel, "KEY INSIGHT" eyebrow |
| Plain `<p>`                             | **Below-Note**   | hairline rule + body text               |
| `<p>` containing only `_italic_` markdown | **Annotation** | `✦` glyph + muted label-size text       |

A slide may carry one Key Insight (blockquote) plus one trailing-paragraph register (below-note OR annotation), in that order. See `examples/gallery.md` slide 21 for key-insight + below-note, slide 22 for key-insight + annotation.

---

## Feature: Overflow Warning

Every slide is a fixed 1280×720 frame with `overflow: hidden`. Content that exceeds the frame is clipped silently — easy to miss in a deck of 60+ slides. Lattice tags any overflowing `<section>` with the class `overflow`, which the theme renders as a **4 px inset red ring**. Authors get a loud, unmissable signal in every render path.

**Detection.** Pure DOM measurement — `scrollHeight > clientHeight + 12` (12 px filters sub-pixel rounding noise from nested borders and shadows). Runs in three places:

| Pipeline                | Source                                         | When it fires                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| VS Code Marp preview    | `lattice-runtime.js` → `startOverflowWatcher()` | After Mermaid init, on every DOM mutation, on resize |
| `node lattice-emulator.js …`     | inline `<script>` baked into the HTML output    | On `DOMContentLoaded` and on resize      |
| `node lattice-emulator.js … pdf` | Puppeteer `page.evaluate()` before `page.pdf()` | Once per build; also logs `⚠ Overflow on slide N` to the console |

**What authors see.** The red ring is drawn via `box-shadow: inset` so it never shifts layout. Build-time also prints a console warning naming each offending slide. There is no opt-in, no debug flag, and no way to silence it short of fixing the slide.

**No false positives in the gallery.** A 12 px tolerance was chosen empirically: the Lattice gallery (71 slides) renders zero rings; injecting one item past the fold lights up the offending slide on the next save.

## Documented Variants

These are named variations of existing templates. Use them when the base template almost fits but needs one structural addition.

### Variant: T11 with Below Note

Extends Template 12 (Comparison with connector). Adds a full-width framing paragraph below the two cards.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  header                                 │
│  LABEL                                  │
│  Comparison Heading                     │
│                                         │
│   ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐   │
│   │ Card A      │  →  │ Card B      │   │
│   │ content     │     │ content     │   │
│   └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘   │
│                                         │
│  Framing sentence that applies to       │
│   both sides equally. Max 30 words.     │
│                                         │
│  footer                           1/19  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS addition to T11:**

- After the card row: `margin-top: 20px`
- Framing paragraph: `font-size: 15-17px; color: var(--text-body); line-height: 1.6; max-width: 800px`
- The note sits below the cards with more margin above it than the gap between the cards — this signals it is a comment on the comparison, not a third card

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: compare-prose -->

## Heading

- **Option A**
  - Body text for the left card.
- **Option B**
  - Body text for the right card.

Optional framing sentence below the cards.
```

**How the renderer maps this:** Same as T11, except a trailing paragraph (not inside a list item) is rendered as the framing note below the cards.

---

### Variant: T13 Step Cards

Extends Template 14 (Timeline / Process). Replaces the dot-on-line with equal-width numbered step cards arranged horizontally.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  header                                 │

│  footer                          12/19  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `list-steps`

**Layout spec:**

- Each `li`: flex column card with `--bg-alt` fill, `--border` border, `--radius-md` corners
- **STEP badge**: auto-generated by CSS — `STEP 01`, `STEP 02`… — 13px mono, letter-spaced, `--text-muted`; do **not** author it in the Markdown
- Card header: 18px (`--fs-md`) bold, `--text-heading` — auto-bolded by CSS, no `**...**` required
- Card body (nested `ul/ol > li` or `p`): 16px (`--fs-body`), `--text-body`
- `❯` chevron connectors between cards: CSS-generated, not authored
- 2–4 cards; use T13 (dot-on-line) for 5–6 steps with shorter labels
- Use `ol` (not `ul`) to get the auto-generated `STEP 01` badge

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: list-steps -->

## How to roll this out across your organization.

1. Pick one team and one decision type
   - Start with a team that already has a regular prioritization rhythm.
2. Log everything, decide nothing differently
   - In the first month, do not change how you make decisions. Log only.
3. Run your first retrospective
   - At day 30, score the logged decisions against outcomes. You will find patterns.
4. Expand to a second team
   - With one retrospective complete, you have evidence. Use it.
```

**How the renderer maps this:** Each `ol > li` → one step card. The first text line is the step title (auto-bolded by CSS). Nested `ul/ol > li` items form the card body. The `STEP 01` badge and `❯` chevron connectors are CSS-generated — do not author them in the Markdown.

**When to use:** Steps that need more content than a dot label can hold. Use dot-on-line (T13) for light orientation with short labels; use step cards when each step needs a title plus a sentence of description. Use `ol` to activate the `STEP 01` eyebrow badge.

---

### Variant: T14 Tabular Inline

Extends Template 15 (List / Bullet Points). Each list item carries right-aligned metadata columns — creating a pseudo-table within a list structure.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  header                                 │
│  LABEL                                  │
│  Growth is a change in thinking.        │
│                                         │
│  01  Remember    Recall facts  Feature  │
│  02  Understand  Explain it    Module   │
│  03  Apply       Use patterns  Service  │
│  04  Analyze     Decompose     System   │
│ 05  Evaluate    Judge option  Org       │
│  06  Create      Synthesize    Entrp.   │
│                                         │
│  footer                           3/19  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `list-tabular`

**Layout spec:**

- `section.list-tabular ol`: `list-style: none; counter-reset; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px; justify-content: center`
- Each top-level `li`: `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 44px 160px 1fr 240px; align-items: baseline; column-gap: var(--sp-sm)`
- Counter column: `::before` renders `counter(..., decimal-leading-zero)` in mono `--accent`
- Name column: inherits `--fs-emphasis` weight 700 `--text-heading` from the parent li — **author writes plain text, CSS does the bolding** (a leading `**name**` still works but is no longer required)
- Description column: `--fs-body`, `--text-body`
- Metadata column: `--fs-xs`, `--text-label`, right-aligned, set via author's `_italic_` span

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: list-tabular -->

## Six dimensions, what they measure, how they are scored.

1. Confidence
   - Number of independent sources corroborating the signal
   - _1–5 · Auto-scored_
2. Recency
   - Time-decay from signal date, configurable half-life
   - _0.0–1.0 · Auto-scored_
3. Relevance
   - Alignment to current strategic bets, owner-scored
   - _1–5 · Manual_
```

**How the renderer maps this:** Each top-level `<li>` carries the row name as plain text (or wrapped in `**...**` — both work). The nested `<ul>` carries two children: the description, then the metadata as `_italic_`. `lattice-emulator.js` flattens the nested form to `<li><strong>name</strong>desc<em>meta</em></li>`; in the VS Code preview, CSS `display:contents` promotes the inner `<li>`s into the parent grid so the same markdown renders correctly without the build step.

**Authoring rule:** the leading `**bold**` is optional. The framework's "CSS does the emphasis, not the author" convention applies here as it does on `list-criteria`, `actors`, `decision`, and the other structured layouts.

**When to use:** A list where each item has structured metadata — level + scope, item + type + status, verb + description + context. Gives the list the scannability of a table while preserving the flowing left-to-right reading order of a list. Switch to T22 if readers need to scan down columns as much as across rows.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  header                                 │
│  LABEL                ┌──────────────┐  │

```

**CSS class:** `image` (default: image right) · `image left` (image left)

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: image -->
```

- Text occupies left half; background image fills right half
- Use `image left` modifier to flip: image left, text right
- Text padding auto-adjusted so content never overlaps the image

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: image -->

`Layout · Image`

## Images sit naturally beside text when you need visual evidence.

Use `_class: image` with `![bg right fit](url)` — image-right is the default. The `fit` keyword tells Marp's renderer (and ours) to letterbox the image inside its slot rather than crop it.

![bg right fit](path/to/image.jpg)
```

```markdown
<!-- _class: image left -->

`Layout · Image Left`

## Flip the image to the left when the composition benefits.

![bg left fit](path/to/image.jpg)
```

- `` `inline code` `` paragraph = eyebrow label
- `h2` = heading
- `p` = body text
- `![bg right fit](url)` / `![bg left fit](url)` = Marp background image directive

**Image sizing — proportions are always preserved.**

Always include the `fit` keyword (`![bg right fit](url)`). It tells Marp to letterbox the image inside its slot at native aspect ratio, never cropped or distorted. Without `fit`, Marp's default is `cover`, which crops arbitrary photos. Whatever bands remain show the lattice pattern as intentional brand framing.

| Layout | Slot aspect | Ideal source |
|---|---|---|
| `image` / `image left` | ≈ 8 : 9 (half of 16 : 9 canvas) | 640 × 720, or any 8 : 9 portrait-ish photo |
| `image-full` | 16 : 9 | 1280 × 720, or any wide landscape |

Bring whatever you have. A square crop in a half-canvas slot will show small top/bottom bands. A portrait photo on a full canvas will show wide left/right bands. Both look intentional — the lattice frames the image instead of dead space.

**CSS class:** `code`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: code -->
```

- Code block (`pre/code`) fills all remaining vertical space after the headings
- Dark code background (`#001D33`) with spectrum-colored bottom bar accent
- Monospace font (`--font-mono`), small size (`--fs-sm`), light text (`#C5D8F5`)

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: code -->

`Implementation · Token Pipeline`

## The tokenization call is three lines of application code.

`JavaScript · SDK v2 interface`

~~~javascript
const tokens = await client.tokenize(input, {
  model: "signal-v2",

});
~~~
```

- `` `inline code` `` paragraph (first) = eyebrow
- `h2` = heading
- `` `inline code` `` paragraph (second, after `h2`) = language/context label above the code block
- Fenced code block = the code (fills remaining space)

**CSS class:** `compare-code`

**Marp directive:**
```markdown
<!-- _class: compare-code -->
```

- Two equal code columns (`1fr 1fr`), gap `--sp-md`
- Each column: inline-code label (`p > code`) above a code block (`pre`)
- Same dark code style as `code` template

**Marp markdown source:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: compare-code -->

`Before & After · Key Distribution`

## File-distributed keys versus vault-integrated keys.

`Before · File-distributed`

~~~python
SECRET_KEY = os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]
hmac.new(SECRET_KEY, payload)
~~~

`After · HSM / KMS integrated`

~~~python
signature = vault.sign(payload, key_id="prod-hmac-v3")
~~~
```

- `` `inline code` `` paragraph before `h2` = optional eyebrow (spans both columns)
- `h2` = heading (spans both columns)
- `` `inline code` `` paragraph (first after `h2`) = left column label
- First code block = left column
- `` `inline code` `` paragraph (second after `h2`) = right column label
- Second code block = right column

**Why inline code, not `h3`, for column labels:** `h3` is a heading level and triggers heading-order lint rules. Column labels are display labels, not headings — the same semantic role as eyebrows on other slide types. Using inline-code paragraphs is consistent with the project-wide eyebrow convention and simplifies the CSS (eyebrow detection uses `:has(> p ~ h2)` rather than the ambiguous `:has(h3 ~ h2)`; nested `:has()` is avoided because Marp's Chromium build does not support it).

**CSS class:** `glossary`

**Authoring contract — write a 2-level nested bullet list:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: glossary -->

## Glossary

- AES-256
  - Symmetric block cipher with a 256-bit key. The cryptographic primitive underneath FF1.
- Audit anchor
  - The HSM unwrap log. The application cannot falsify it; examiners read it directly.
- DEK
  - Data Encryption Key. 32 bytes of AES-256 key material, used in-process to tokenize.
```

The runtime transforms that into a 2-column glossary table. The author **never writes the table, the `<strong>` tags, or the alphabet pill** — all three are derived.

**What the runtime does automatically:**

| Thing | Source | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 2-column table | first top-level `<ul>` in the slide | `<table><thead>…<tbody>…` |
| Header row | injected unconditionally | `<th>Term</th><th>Definition</th>` with spectrum-gradient bottom border |
| Term auto-bold | first child of each top-level `<li>` | `<strong>AES-256</strong>` in accent color |
| Definition cell | nested `<ul><li>` under each term | second `<td>` |
| Alphabet pill in h2 | first character of first and last term | `<span class="range-pill">A – G</span>` right-aligned in h2 |
| Zebra striping | `tbody tr:nth-child(odd)` | odd rows tinted with `--bg-alt` so the first body row pairs with the header chrome |

**Three pipelines, identical output:**

| Channel | Where | When |
|---|---|---|
| `marp-cli` build | [marp.config.js](../marp.config.js) `glossaryListToTable` + `glossaryRange` | parse-time, token-level |
| LLM-env emulator | [lattice-emulator.js](../lattice-emulator.js) post-processor | render-time, HTML-string |
| VS Code Marp preview | [lattice-runtime.js](../lattice-runtime.js) MutationObserver | client-side, DOM-level |

The runtime path is what makes the live preview work — VS Code's Marp extension does not load project-local Marpit plugins, so the DOM injector is the only channel for the preview, and it must stay in lockstep with the other two.

**Layout spec:**

- `section.glossary table`: `width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: auto`
- `thead tr`: `background: var(--spectrum) bottom / 100% 2px no-repeat` — the header row carries the same spectrum-gradient separator used by the slide top stripe and section dividers, replacing a flat 1px border with brand chrome
- `thead th`: uppercase mono label tone (`--text-muted`, `--fs-label`, `letter-spacing: 0.08em`) — TERM and DEFINITION share identical styling; do not tint the term header
- `td:first-child` (term): `color: var(--accent); font-weight: 600; white-space: nowrap; padding-right: var(--sp-md)` — keep terms short; long terms use a hyphen for line-break safety
- `td` (definition): `padding: 6px var(--sp-sm); color: var(--text-body); border-bottom: none`
- `tbody tr:nth-child(odd)`: `background: var(--bg-alt)` — zebra rows starting on row 1 so the header reads as paired chrome
- `h2`: `display: flex; justify-content: space-between` — pill is right-aligned to the slide edge with `margin-left: auto`
- `h2 .range-pill`: `border-radius: 999px; background: var(--accent-soft); border: 1px solid var(--accent); color: var(--accent); padding: 3px 12px; font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: var(--fs-label); letter-spacing: 0.06em` — same recipe as `.badge`, sits naturally alongside other categorical chips

**Capacity:** 12–16 short entries fit per slide at the default density. Split alphabetically (A–G, H–R, S–Z) when the list runs longer.

**When to use:** appendix glossaries, term-of-art reference for technical decks, acronym pages. Use whenever you'd reach for a 2-column table whose left side is a short noun and right side is a sentence — the nested-list authoring is faster, harder to misformat, and free-of-charge gives you the alphabet pill that orients the reader on multi-page glossaries.

**Future:** the auto-derivation pattern (`{range}` was the original placeholder, since dropped in favor of unconditional injection) generalizes to other deck-wide tokens — `{date}`, `{slide-count}`, `{deck-version}`. When a second use case lands the runtime can grow a small token table; for now glossary range is the only consumer.

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS class:** `checklist`

**Marp directive:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: checklist -->
```

- Vertical list of state-marked rows. Each item is one line: a state glyph (✓ / ~ / ☐) in the leading column, the label in the body column.
- States authored as a leading marker on each item — see [State Convention](#state-convention) for the full mapping:
  - `[x]` → done (✓, `--pass` green, soft pass tint, pass-coloured left bar)
  - `[~]` → partial (~, `--warn` amber, soft warn tint, warn-coloured left bar)
  - `[ ]` → todo (☐, `--fail` red, soft fail tint, fail-coloured left bar)
- Optional `_em italic_` tail on any item renders as a muted annotation in the same line.
- Rows space evenly to fill the slide height; standard density holds 5–8 items comfortably.

**Authoring contract — flat bullet list, one item per row:**

```markdown
<!-- _class: checklist -->

`Phase 1 · Acceptance review`

## What shipped, what slipped, what stayed open.

- [x] Codebook signing live across all production tenants
- [x] HSM-anchored audit trail readable by Examiner role
- [x] One reference client integrated end-to-end
- [~] TTL refresh under cold-start load — _open, see slide 27_
- [ ] Multi-tenant codebook operation — _Phase 2_
- [ ] Crypto-shred runbook hand-off to Platform — _Phase 2_
```

**How the renderer maps this:** A Marpit plugin (`checklistItemStates` in [marp.config.js](../../marp.config.js)) walks each top-level `<li>` whose text begins with `[x]`, `[~]`, or `[ ]`, strips the marker, and adds `class="state pass|warn|fail"` to the `<li>`. CSS draws the glyph as a `::before` pseudo-element. The same transformation runs in `lattice-emulator.js` (build pipeline) and `lattice-runtime.js` (VS Code preview) so the three channels stay in sync.

**State palette:** Reuses the `--pass` / `--warn` / `--fail` tokens (and their `*-bg` soft fills) that both themes ship at WCAG AA on body backgrounds. See the [State Convention](#state-convention) section for the canonical mapping shared with `verdict-grid`.

**When to use:** acceptance reviews, retro snapshots, "what shipped vs what slipped" summaries — any slide where the editorial point is *the mix of states*, not the body text behind each row. If items need a sentence of body context, reach for `verdict-grid` or `list-criteria` instead. If items are equal-weight bullets without state, use `tldr` or `list`.

---

## Dark Modifier

**Applies to any layout class.** Add `dark` alongside the layout class to switch the slide to a dark palette using the theme's dark color tokens.

**Marp directive:**
```markdown
<!-- _class: content dark -->
<!-- _class: list dark -->
<!-- _class: divider dark -->
<!-- _class: image-full dark -->
```

- Retokens: `--bg`, `--bg-alt`, `--border`, `--text-*` all switch to `var(--dark-*)` values
- Spectrum bar changes: instead of a 4px solid top border, dark slides render a 1px spectrum line as a CSS `background` at the top
- Use for mid-deck emphasis slides, impactful data reveals, or transitional moments
- Gallery uses: `content dark`, `list dark`, `cards-stack dark`, `divider dark`, `image-full dark`
