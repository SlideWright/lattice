// Playwright E2E for the Studio (route `/studio/`). Governed by
// engineering/decisions/2026-06-28-experience-gating-playwright.md.
//
// WHY a built site, not `astro dev`: the dev server's Vite dep-optimizer throws
// 504 "Outdated Optimize Dep" on the Studio island's lazy imports (the engine +
// heavy lint/chat bundles), which makes the preview flaky. `astro preview` on a
// production build has no Vite optimizer — deterministic and prod-like. So the
// webServer builds (without the slow `showcase:check` rasterization, irrelevant
// to E2E) then previews. Locally, `reuseExistingServer` picks up a preview you
// already have running so you don't rebuild every run.
//
// Browser: Chromium from the sandbox at PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers
// (build 1194 ↔ @playwright/test 1.56.1). In CI, provision the pinned browser
// explicitly (the version pin IS the browser pin). See the decision doc
// §"Sandbox + CI browser provisioning".
//
// WEBKIT IS REACHABLE FROM THE SANDBOX — it is simply not preinstalled:
//
//   cd docs && npx playwright install-deps webkit && npx playwright install webkit
//
// (~2 min, lands in the same PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH.) This note used to read
// "Chromium only / do NOT run playwright install here", which cost real time: it
// stopped an investigation of #1554 — a WebKit-only duplicate-paint bug on
// `math compare` — on the belief that the engine could not be run here at all. It
// can, and the `webkit-phone` / `webkit-tablet` projects below are worth driving
// locally before trusting a Chromium pass on anything engine-divergent.
//
// trace + video are ON by default (decision doc §"Watching a run") so every run
// leaves an RPA-style, scrubable record — the same artifacts the nightly relies
// on to make a failure reproducible without re-running.
