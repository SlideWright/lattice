/**
 * AXE — the WCAG rule set over the WEBSITE (`lattice.style`): the half of G10 that
 * was never closed.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `test/integration/invariants/axe-a11y.test.js` runs axe over the two
 * SHIPPED DECK SHELLS — the export HTML and the standalone player. It says so in its own
 * docblock, and it is right to: those are the artifacts a deck becomes. But Lattice has
 * TWO execution environments, and the other one — the site, the component reference, the
 * Playground, the Studio — had no automated accessibility scan of any kind. The nearest
 * thing, `tools/check-shadcn-bridge-contrast.js`, grades TOKEN MATH: it mixes the bridge's
 * derived colors and scores the pairs. It passed, every palette, every mode, the whole
 * time the component reference was rendering its ACTIVE nav item as --accent ink on an
 * --accent pill — a 1:1 ratio, an invisible label — because the tokens were never the
 * problem. An unlayered `a { color: var(--accent) }` in `landing.css` beat the @layer-ed
 * Tailwind utility that was supposed to color it, and no amount of token arithmetic can
 * see a cascade. That is the gap this file closes: the rendered DOM, in a real browser,
 * at the widths and in the modes people actually use.
 *
 * THE `equalRatio` ARM, and why the budget is not just "violations". axe files an EXACT
 * 1:1 contrast as `incomplete`, not a violation — messageKey `equalRatio`, on the sound
 * theory that ink matching its ground is sometimes deliberate hiding. So the single worst
 * contrast defect on the site was invisible to a violations-only scan, which is a fair
 * description of how it survived. We enforce that one messageKey out of the incomplete
 * bucket and NOTHING else from it: the rest of `incomplete` on this site is `bgOverlap` /
 * `bgGradient` / `elmPartiallyObscured` — 800-odd nodes where axe genuinely cannot resolve
 * a background behind a gradient or an overlapping box. Those are unknowns, not defects,
 * and enforcing them would be a scoreboard.
 *
 * WIDTHS AND MODES. Routed to desktop (1440), tablet (820) and mobile (390) by the
 * `@a11y` tag, because the QUALITY BAR makes all three first-class — and because it is
 * load-bearing here, not ceremony: every `scrollable-region-focusable` finding on this
 * site exists ONLY at 390px, where a table or a code block starts to overflow. A
 * desktop-only scan reported those pages clean. Each route is scanned in BOTH color
 * modes in the same test, since contrast is the one class that differs between them
 * (all four original contrast defects were light-mode-only).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, so the green is not read as more than it is:
 *   · ONE palette — whatever `cuoio` (the default) resolves to. 17 other palettes ship,
 *     and a rendered-DOM contrast defect in one of them would pass here. The token-side
 *     sweep over all of them is `tools/contrast-audit.js` + `theme-surface-aa.test.js`;
 *     between the two, what is NOT covered anywhere is a rendered cascade defect in a
 *     non-default palette.
 *   · TWELVE routes of ~88. The component reference alone is 61 pages built from one
 *     template, and this scans one of them.
 *   · The FIRST PAINT of each route only — no route is driven. Nothing here opens a
 *     Sheet, a Popover, a Command palette, the Studio's panels or its Fabricate flow,
 *     so every dialog, menu and transient surface on the site is unscanned. That is
 *     where most of the site's remaining `text-muted-foreground/70`-style alpha-diluted
 *     ink lives (30 occurrences at last count, 26 of them in the Studio).
 *   · KEYBOARD BEHAVIOR beyond what a static rule can see: focus order, focus-visible
 *     ring contrast, WCAG 2.2's 2.4.11 (focus not obscured) and 2.4.13 (focus appearance)
 *     are all outside axe's rule set and outside this file.
 *   · The engine render inside the Playground/Studio PREVIEW IFRAME (`frame-tested` is
 *     reported `incomplete` on those routes and left there) — that content is the deck,
 *     and the deck's own shells are gated by the engine-side axe test.
