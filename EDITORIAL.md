# Editorial

The prose rules for writing the words on the slides. These are about
style and rhythm, not layout. The layouts in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) tell
you where to put text. This file tells you how it should sound.

## Headers are complete sentences

Every H2 (`## ...`) is a complete declarative sentence. Not a noun phrase,
not a fragment, not a question.

```md
## The codebook is signed by the control plane.   ← yes
## Codebook signing                                ← no
## How does the codebook get signed?               ← no
```

The reason: a deck is read at speed. A reader scans the H2 to know what
the slide is *about*. A noun phrase makes them work. A complete sentence
delivers the slide's claim.

A complete sentence in the H2 also forces the writer to figure out what
the slide is actually saying. "Codebook signing" doesn't commit to
anything. "The codebook is signed by the control plane" makes a claim,
and now the body has to support it.

## Speak-first writing

Every line of body prose should be readable aloud without stumbling. Read
each sentence as if presenting it. If you trip over a possessive cluster
or a polysyllabic pileup, rewrite.

Specifically avoid:

**Possessive stacking.** "The system's policy's enforcement mechanism's
configuration" is unreadable aloud. Restructure: "The system enforces
policy through a configurable mechanism." One possessive at a time.

**Polysyllabic pileups.** "Operationalizing implementation methodology"
is three abstractions deep with no concrete noun in sight. Find a
concrete noun. "Putting the implementation into practice" or "Day-to-day
use" — pick one.

**Nominalizations of verbs.** "Provide the validation" → "validate."
"Make the determination" → "decide." Strong verbs carry meaning faster
than verbs-of-existence-with-a-noun-after-them.

## Cadence variation between slides

A deck where every slide opens "We need to..." or every H2 is "How
[verb]ing X [verbs] Y" reads as monotone. Vary sentence length, varying
opening, vary verb choice deliberately across slides.

A useful pattern is **claim and deliver**. The H2 makes the claim. The
body delivers the support. Don't restate the claim in the body opening.

```md
## The audit log lives outside the platform's control.

Every DEK unwrap operation is logged by CloudHSM itself, in a stream
the platform cannot write to. A compromised application cannot forge
or erase the trail.
```

The body doesn't open with "The audit log is external because..." —
that would just paraphrase the H2. It opens by *delivering* on the
claim with the specific mechanism.

## Concrete nouns over abstract ones

When you have a choice, prefer the concrete noun.

- "AWS CloudHSM" beats "the key management infrastructure"
- "Twelve weeks" beats "a meaningful timeline"
- "The control plane signs the codebook" beats "Authorization happens
  at the control-plane layer"

Concrete nouns are faster to read, easier to remember, and harder to
fake. Abstract nouns let the writer hide behind ambiguity. A deck that
trades abstract nouns for concrete ones tightens by 20-30% on average.

## Active voice, named actors

Most slide prose should be active voice with the actor named:

- "The SDK verifies the signature" beats "The signature is verified"
- "Procurement files the request" beats "A request is filed"

The exception is when the actor is genuinely irrelevant (passive: "The
codebook is signed before issuance" — fine if the next sentence names
who) or when the verb is the focus (passive: "The DEK is zeroed on
close" — emphasizes the zeroing, not the zeroer).

Named actors also make role-based prose work. "The HSM admin manages
KEK lifecycle. The platform operator manages policy. The application
holds time-bound codebooks." Three sentences, three actors, clear
boundaries — the structure delivers the access-control story without
any extra explanation.

## Numbered lists, ordered or not

If the order of items matters (steps, phases, ranked priorities), use a
numbered list. If it doesn't, use bullets. Don't use numbers for visual
emphasis — readers read "1, 2, 3" as sequence.

Within a list, every item should be parallel in structure. If item 1 is
a verb phrase, item 2 should be a verb phrase. If item 1 is a noun
followed by a colon, every item follows the same pattern.

## Card titles

When using cards-grid, compare-prose, featured, or similar layouts where
each card has a short title, the titles should be **noun phrases of
similar weight**. Not sentences (the H2 is the sentence). Not a mix of
noun phrases and verb phrases.

Good card title sets:

- "Layer 1 · HSM audit" / "Layer 2 · Control plane audit" / "Layer 3 · SDK local audit"
- "Strategic Bets" / "Quick Wins" / "Defer" / "Time Sinks"
- "What works" / "What requires tuning"

Bad card title sets:

- "Layer 1 · HSM audit" / "Validate the application" / "Bonus: SDK"

Parallel structure helps the reader scan the cards as a set.

## Eyebrows over preambles

Mono-uppercase eyebrows (`` `Context · Why this matters` `` as an inline-code
paragraph above the heading) carry positioning information without using a
sentence to do it. Use an eyebrow to say where the slide sits in the
argument. Don't open the body with "In this section we'll discuss..." —
the eyebrow already told the reader.

## Closing slide style

The closing slide gets one sentence. The H2 carries the action. The
body, if any, is a single italic line stating the next step or a
calling-back of the deck's central claim. Resist the temptation to
list bullet-point next steps; that's what a follow-up email is for.
