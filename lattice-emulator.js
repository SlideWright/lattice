/**
 * lattice-emulator.js — the Lattice CLI: HTML renderer + PDF exporter
 *
 * This is the package's `bin` and `main` (built to dist/lattice-emulator.js).
 * It renders on the OWNED engine (lib/engine/), which is canonical for every
 * first-party render path — this CLI and the browser runtime both interpret it.
 * It emits the section elements, pagination attribute, and header/footer
 * structure that lattice.css targets.
 *
 * The name is historical. The file began as a Marp CLI stand-in during the
 * migration, and the HTML shape it emits stays Marpit-compatible on purpose
 * (that compatibility is what LFM specifies and what Export-to-Marp hands
 * off) — but nothing here defers to Marp, and lattice.css is written for
 * this engine, not for Marp. See engineering/marp-independence.md.
 *
 * Mermaid diagrams (```mermaid blocks) are rendered to SVG in an engine-owned
 * Puppeteer page (lib/integrations/mermaid/render-worker.js), with theme variables
 * mapped to the Lattice palette and the engine's own fonts loaded before Mermaid
 * measures a label.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node lattice-emulator.js <source.md> <output.pdf> [palette]
 *   node lattice-emulator.js <source.md> <custom-layouts.css> <output.pdf> [palette]
 *
 * The bundled `lattice.css` is auto-resolved when no `.css` arg is given;
 * pass an explicit `.css` path only to override the layout engine (rare —
 * for layout-engine development, not deck authoring).
 *
 * Want a copy someone can render with Marp instead? That is a one-way
 * EXPORT, not a render path: `npm run export:marp` (lib/core/marp-bundle.js)
 * produces a self-contained bundle the recipient renders with their own
 * marp-cli. What such a render does and does not reproduce is the ledger in
 * lib/core/marp-fidelity.js.

// Inline each local `logo-wall` mark as a REAL `<svg>` for the export path.
// The logo-marks transform emits `<span class="logo-mark" … style="--logo-mask:
// url('<src>')">` — a CSS `mask` that renders cleanly in a live browser but NOT
// reliably in print-to-PDF (different PDF rasterisers honor the soft-mask
// differently: poppler-splash hairlines the group, cairo drops it and shows a
// solid box). So for the PDF we swap each mask span for the mark's actual SVG
// vector, given the marks authored with `fill="currentColor"`: the inline svg
// inherits `color: var(--logo-ink)` (logo-mark-svg rule), so it's the SAME token
// color as the preview — robust across every PDF viewer. Local marks only;
// remote (http) / already-inlined (data:) srcs are left as the mask span.
// Order-independent: match an empty `<span>` carrying the `logo-mark` class
// anywhere in its attribute run, and pull `--logo-mask` / `aria-label` out of the
// captured attrs — so a future change to the span's attribute order can't silently
// drop the inline-SVG swap and leave the unreliable mask in the PDF.

USAGE
  node lattice-emulator.js <source.md> <output.pdf|.pptx|.png|.zip|.html> [palette]
  node lattice-emulator.js <source.md> <custom.css> <output> [palette]

ARGUMENTS
  source.md          Markdown source (required)
  output             Output path (required); the extension picks the format, and an
                     extension that is not on this list is a usage error rather than
                     a PDF under the wrong name (a path with NO extension is still
                     the PDF path — nothing is mislabeled when nothing is labeled):
                       .pdf   vector PDF, selectable text (+ HTML sidecar; or one
                              image per page with --raster)
                       .pptx  PowerPoint, one full-bleed slide image per slide
                       .png   one PNG per slide, written as <output>.NNN.png
                       .zip   an IMAGE SET — a zip of one raster per slide
                              (PNG/JPEG/WebP) plus opt-in thumbnails and
                              standalone chart/diagram SVGs (see IMAGE SET below)
                       .html  the rendered HTML as the DELIVERABLE — no PDF is
                              written. Still a real browser render (auto-split and
                              the overflow/legibility passes measure laid-out DOM,
                              and this file is their post-split result); it only
                              skips the PDF encode
                     For every format EXCEPT .html, an HTML sidecar is written
                     alongside; with .html that sidecar IS the output file.
                     For per-slide JPEG or WebP, ask for a .zip and pass
                     --image-format jpeg|webp — there is no loose .jpg/.webp output.
  custom.css         Optional layout CSS override; if omitted, the bundled
                     lattice.css from the install dir is used
  palette            Palette name (e.g. 'indaco', 'cuoio')

OPTIONS
  -h, --help              Show this help and exit
  -v, --version           Show version and exit
  -o, --output PATH       Output path (alternative to positional output)
  -p, --palette NAME      Palette name (alternative to positional palette)
  -c, --css PATH          Layout CSS override (alternative to positional custom.css)
  -q, --quiet             Suppress non-error progress output
      --notes             Also write a plaintext speaker-notes sidecar
                          (<output>.notes.txt), one block per slide
      --captions          Also write read-along WebVTT caption sidecars — one
                          deck-level <output>.vtt (continuous timeline) plus
                          per-slide <output>.NN.vtt. Each slide narrates its own
                          CONTENT unless the author overrode it with a caption.
                          Timing is Cadenza's estimate (no audio, no key); honors
                          --strip-captions
      --no-split          Do NOT paginate an overflowing slide — render it whole
                          and let it ring. INSTRUMENTATION only: a measurement rig
                          needs page N to stay slide N. A deck that means to show
                          overflow marks the slide <!-- stress-slide --> instead
      --strip-notes       Scrub speaker notes from every output copy (the player
                          DOM, the PDF annotations, AND the embedded source) — a
                          shareable file with no speaker text. Removes the NOTE
                          channel only: a <!-- describe: --> accessibility
                          description survives (it is the slide's text
                          alternative, not speaker text), and so do captions,
                          which narrate slide content and have --strip-captions
      --no-player-motion  Ship the STILL in the exported player, even when the deck
                          sets motion: on. Motion in a file you forward is a
                          separate choice from motion while you present — it costs
                          bytes and it moves for a recipient you are not there to
                          frame it for. The front-matter equivalent is
                          player-motion: off; this flag is for the scripted export
      --strip-captions    Scrub the author's caption OVERRIDES (inline <!-- caption: -->
                          and front-matter captions:) from the .vtt and embedded
                          source; those slides fall back to the generated projection.
                          Orthogonal to --strip-notes — a speaker note is never a
                          caption source, so neither flag can leak the other's channel
      --notes-icon        Show a clickable sticky-note icon on each slide with
                          a note (default: notes are embedded but hidden)
      --fluid             Emit the .html as the opt-in fluid-box VIEWER: each
                          slide fills the viewport and reflows to portrait on a
                          phone (swipe between slides), with a toggle back to the
                          fixed deck. PDF/PPTX/PNG outputs are unchanged. Can also
                          be enabled per-deck with a 'fluid: true' front-matter key.
      --player            Emit the .html as the self-contained PLAYER: a portable,
                          offline, double-clickable file with three views (Present,
                          Read Slides, Read Article), all assets inlined, the slide
                          HTML sanitized under a strict CSP, and the deck source
                          embedded for lossless re-import. Supersedes --fluid. Can
                          also be enabled with a 'player: true' front-matter key.
      --present           Mark the PDF to open directly in full-screen
                          presentation mode (Adobe Acrobat/Reader and most desktop
                          viewers honor this; browser-embedded viewers ignore it
                          harmlessly). Adds a subtle cross-fade between slides;
                          slides stay presenter-driven (no auto-advance). PDF only.
                          Can also be enabled per-deck with a 'present: true'
                          front-matter key.
      --print             Render in PRINT mode: a B&W-safe, ink-on-white band
                          (grayscale + hatch/dot textures for chart & diagram
                          series) for paper handouts, instead of the screen /
                          color palette. Every text token clears WCAG AA on
                          white. Any output format; also settable per-deck with
                          'color-mode: print'.
      --raster            Print the PDF as one full-bleed slide image per page
                          (2x JPEG, from the same screenshots the PPTX path
                          takes) instead of vector pages. Maximum viewer
                          compatibility; selectable text is lost. Speaker
                          notes, --present, and --embed-source still apply.
                          PDF only.
      --paper <size>      Fit each slide onto a standard sheet — auto | letter |
                          legal | a4 — instead of the default slide-sized page,
                          so the PDF prints correctly on office paper (baked
                          paper MediaBox, 9mm safe margin, fit + centered, never
                          cropped). auto picks the least-wasteful sheet for the
                          deck's aspect (16:9 → US Legal, 4:3 → Letter). This is
                          a raster paper-fit (like the Studio Print drawer);
                          selectable text is lost. PDF only.
      --orientation <o>   auto | landscape | portrait for --paper (auto follows
                          the deck aspect). Implies --paper auto if given alone.
      --lens <ids>        Export only the slides the named READER VIEWS show —
                          one id, or a comma list, or 'full'. Views are declared
                          in the deck's front-matter 'lenses:' block and each one
                          must have been APPROVED by a human; an unavailable view
                          (unknown / hidden / unapproved / empty / drifted) exits
                          non-zero naming the reason and writes nothing, rather
                          than falling back to the full deck. Several views need
                          --player, which carries them behind a switcher; every
                          other format is one linear sequence, so it takes one.
                          WHAT THIS WITHHOLDS, AND WHAT IT ONLY HIDES: slides
                          outside the views you export are genuinely absent from
                          the file. Slides INSIDE a multi-view carrier are only
                          hidden — switching is a display rule, so every view in
                          one file is reachable from that file. Export one view
                          per file for a recipient who must not have the others.
      --lens-default <id> Which of the --lens views the player OPENS on. Must be
                          one of the ids you exported; naming any other exits
                          non-zero. Without it the deck's own 'lens-default:'
                          decides; the first id you named is the last resort.
      --lens-source <s>   What a --lens player's embedded envelope carries:
                          'projected' (default) ships only the slides that
                          shipped; 'full' keeps the deck exactly as authored, so
                          the file still re-imports losslessly — at the cost that
                          a recipient can recover every slide no view showed
                          them. No effect without --lens.
      --embed-source      Attach the deck's Markdown source to the PDF as an
                          embedded file (visible in any viewer's attachments
                          panel), so the deck can be re-rendered from the PDF
                          alone. Note: ships your source (including speaker
                          notes) inside the artifact.
      --overflow-marker <author|reader|off>
                          Who a clipped slide's marker speaks to in the exported
                          artifact. A slide with more content than fits is CLIPPED
                          (not scrollable, not printed), so the export says so
                          rather than losing it quietly. 'reader' (default) draws a
                          calm "Content clipped" tag; 'author' draws the red ring,
                          the "Overflows" flag and the small-type alarm (the
                          per-cell "Fix Me" tags are preview-only — they need the
                          runtime script an export does not carry); 'off' draws
                          nothing, for a deck you have already
                          checked fits. LATTICE_OVERFLOW_MARKER sets a standing
                          default ('off' is per-render only). The overflow warning
                          on stderr is printed at every level.
      --keep-vector-images
                          Keep SVG images as vectors in the PDF. By default SVG
                          <img>/background images are rasterized to 2x PNG at
                          export, because some PDF viewers (iOS Quartz) mishandle
                          the vector constructs Chromium prints for clipped or
                          cropped SVG placements (#690). Inline SVG (Mermaid,
                          charts, logo marks) always stays vector.

  IMAGE SET (.zip output only)
      --image-format <f>  png (default, lossless, perfect fidelity) | jpeg | webp.
                          jpeg/webp are lossy levers for a smaller set; webp is
                          smaller than jpeg at equal quality.
      --image-size <s>    max (default, fidelity-first: 2x for HD, 1x for 4K) |
                          2x | 1x | half. Lower sizes shrink each image and the
                          overall set — the "size selection" lever.
      --image-quality N   Encoder quality 1–100 for jpeg/webp (default 92);
                          ignored for png.
      --image-mode <m>    Color mode for the whole set — inherit (default, the deck's
                          own / palette-resolved) | light | dark | print. light/dark
                          render the palette's light / dark variant; print is the
                          B&W-safe ink-on-white handout mode.
      --svg-background <b>
                          Look for each standalone chart/diagram SVG —
                          inherit (default) | light | dark | print. Controls BOTH
                          the render and the canvas, independent of --image-mode:
                          light/dark render the chart in that scheme; print renders it
                          B&W-safe (grayscale + textures) on white — so you can export
                          color slides but print-ready chart/diagram vectors.
                          inherit follows the slides' color mode, with no canvas.
      --thumb-width N     Thumbnail width in px (default 480); height follows the
                          slide aspect.
      --no-thumbnails     Omit the thumbnails/ folder (thumbnails ship by default).
      --no-svg            Omit the assets/ folder (standalone chart & diagram SVGs
                          ship by default; each opens on its own, fonts embedded).

  Value-taking options accept both --flag value and --flag=value syntax; the
  boolean switches above take no value. Positional args still work; named
  flags take precedence when both are supplied.

SPEAKER NOTES
  A non-directive HTML comment on a slide is that slide's speaker note
  (Marp-faithful; see spec/LFM-1.0.md). Each note is embedded as a per-page PDF
  text annotation and a hidden HTML presenter-notes channel. By default the PDF
  annotation is hidden — the note is embedded and tool-extractable, but no icon
  marks the slide; --notes-icon exposes a clickable sticky note instead. --notes
  additionally writes a plaintext sidecar. Tooling pragmas (markdownlint /
  prettier) are not notes.

PALETTE RESOLUTION (highest precedence first)
  1. CLI palette positional argument
  2. LATTICE_PALETTE environment variable
  3. Deck front-matter \`theme:\` directive
  4. Default 'indaco'

  Available palettes: ${listAvailablePalettes()}

EXIT CODES

// ── The TWO front-matter readers, defined once (HARD RULE #1) ─────────────
// This file used to carry four hand-written copies of "match the front matter" and three of
// "read `size:`", and they did not agree. Two divergences were real, both found by adversarial
// review on #1234, and both landed on the SPLIT GATE — which decides its answer from the deck's
// geometry, so a reader that mis-reads `size:` sends the gate to the wrong box:
//
//   · CRLF. Two copies matched `/^---\n/`, LF only, while `lib/authoring/lint-core.js` and two
//     other readers in THIS file already used `\r?\n`. A deck saved with CRLF line endings has
//     front matter that the marpit engine parses fine — so the engine stamped `data-family="tall"`
//     for `size: story` while this file saw NO front matter at all, defaulted to `hd`, and
//     rendered tall-family CSS into a 1280x720 landscape page with the content clipped. Every
//     other directive (`theme:`, `color-mode:`, `style:`, `fluid:`) was silently dropped with it.
//   · A trailing YAML comment. `size: story # phone` is legal YAML and the value is `story`, but
//     a `$`-anchored value pattern rejects the whole line and falls back to `hd`, while lint's
//     prefix-matching copy accepted it — so lint promised a split the engine would not perform.
//
// `\r?\n` on both sides, and the value pattern tolerates the comment and the `.` that lint has
// always allowed. Strictly a superset of what these matched before: no LF deck changes.

// ── Mermaid renderer ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Two surfaces wire the rendered SVG to the active palette:
//
//   1. themeVariables.  Mermaid inlines a handful of values into the SVG
//      as attributes (gradient stops, gantt grid lines, marker fills).
//      CSS can't reach those — they must come from this map. The map below
//      is structural metadata; values come from the active palette's
//      --diagram-* / --cat-* / --text-* tokens.
//
//   2. lattice.css "DIAGRAM OVERRIDES" section.  Per-diagram CSS
//      (`section .section-N rect { fill: var(--cat-3-fill) }` and so
//      on) that target classes Mermaid emits but doesn't theme. Loaded as
//      a normal page stylesheet via lattice.css; the rendered SVG is
//      embedded inline in the host HTML, so the host stylesheet cascades
//      onto it at PDF-rasterize time — same mechanism the runtime preview
//      already uses. No Mermaid `themeCSS` init parameter is used.
//
// See engineering/decisions/2026-05-12-diagram-tokens.md for the architecture.

// ── Mermaid theme variables — structural map only ───────────────────────
// THE map lives in lib/core/mermaid-theme-map.js, imported by this path and by

// copy in lib/runtime/index.js kept in sync by comment; the two held the same 166
// slots but 38 different VALUES. They are now one object, so a key exists on both
// paths or on neither, and there is one set of values.
//
// The map names which Mermaid theme variable corresponds to which CSS custom
// property in the active palette. The CSS variables hold the actual hex values;
// the map is structural and unchanging across palettes, so adding a palette
// means declaring the same custom properties in themes/<n>.css — never editing
// the map.
//
// The `%%{init}%%` reconciliation kernel (#1311) — how the engine palette and an
// author's own directive coexist, shared with the runtime (HARD RULE #1).
// Required HERE, above the first use: the mermaid pre-pass runs during module
// evaluation, so everything it reaches for must already be bound (the same

 * render — 92%, the largest single cost anywhere in the CLI
 * (engineering/decisions/2026-08-16-render-format-cost-assessment.md §2b). Batching

 * Mermaid bundle is parsed once rather than once per diagram, which is where most of
 * that per-diagram second went. Numbers for the change are in the PR's `## Performance`
 * section (HARD RULE #19).
 *
 * NOT ALL-OR-NOTHING ANY MORE, and that is the other improvement. The `mmdc -i`
 * batch wrote `<out>-1.svg`, `<out>-2.svg`, … and a fence it could not parse simply
 * produced no file — which invalidated the index alignment the caller depends on, so
 * one bad fence sent the WHOLE deck back through the one-at-a-time path. The worker
 * returns an index-aligned result per diagram with its own `ok` flag, so a bad fence
 * costs only itself and the other thirteen are already rendered.
 *
 * Returns an array of finished slide fragments index-aligned with `requests`, or `null`

// the player envelope ships. `--embed-source` attaches `md`: the deck as the author wrote it, so
// the artifact round-trips to an editable deck rather than to machine-expanded output. That is
// the right thing to attach and it is why the two differ. Applying `scrubBoundary` to `md`
// applied a measurement taken on one document to another one, which the fidelity guard never saw.
//
// Three steps, cheapest first, because the expensive one is reached by no deck in this tree.
//   1. `md === rawMd` — no pre-render, no glossary. The measurement is OF this document.
//   2. The two cuts produce the same bytes on `md`. Then the choice cannot change what ships,
//      whatever it was measured on. Two string scrubs, no render. This is the case that covers
//      every pre-processed file in the tree: 45 markdown files carry a comment AND get
//      pre-processed (42 of them decks, the rest prose docs that are never exported), and on none
//      of them does the cut choice change the bytes. The only file that reaches step 3 is
//      `test/fixtures/strip-notes-deck-preprocessed.md`, added to exercise it.
//      Count the fence the way CommonMark does — `/^ {0,3}`{3,} *mermaid/m`. A bare
//      `includes('```mermaid')` says 51, because it also counts files that merely DOCUMENT the
//      fence inside a code sample and never trigger the pre-render at all.
//   3. Otherwise the choice genuinely matters on an unmeasured document, so measure it: render
//      `md` and each cut of it, and keep the one that reproduces it. Fail-closed — if neither
//      does, keep scrubbing (the text still goes from every copy) and say what was given up.
// Memoized because `embedSourceInPdf` has two call sites — the vector path and the raster one —

// These local faces embed the real type into the printed PDF with zero network —
// the whole point of the library carrying its own fonts. The face list is the
// canonical manifest (lib/fonts/text-faces.js), shared with the build emitter
// and the parity gate. Absent (assets/ isn't in the tarball) it returns '' and the
// stylesheet's own `fonts/` URLs are left in place — which this comment used to describe
// as a working FALLBACK. It is not one, and never was: inlined, those urls resolve
// against the OUTPUT directory and 404 there (see `dropCoveredSheetFaces`). Nor can it be
// fixed by rebasing them onto the sheet's own directory, because `fontDir()` returns null
// — the condition that empties this block — only when `dist/fonts/` does not exist, which
// is exactly where such a rebase would point. A tarball with no font bytes anywhere has
// no fonts; the honest reading is that the faces are DECLARED and unresolvable, and the
// deck renders in fallback type. Recorded rather than papered over. Covers the full engine

// second pass became a DUPLICATE. It was not a harmless one: `applyBackdropToHtml` puts
// the finish wrapper ahead of the mark, so the re-run's first-child guard missed and

// valid exactly where a diagram's ink is baked PER SLIDE, and this attribute was what
// said so. It had to exist because the two render paths disagreed about granularity —
// this one baked per slide, the runtime baked ONCE from the first section — so the
// pins were right here and wrong there. Pinned live on a runtime path, a
// `_class: dark` slide got a dark chip under slide-1's dark ink: 1.55:1 in a real
// marp-cli render, where before it was 17.14:1.
//
// #1332 step 3 ended the disagreement: the runtime now resolves its palette from the
// section it is rendering. Both paths bake per slide, the pins are unconditionally
// correct, and an attribute that announces "this render baked per slide" announces
// nothing. Deleted, along with `SLIDE_BAKE_ATTR`/`stampSlideBake` in
// lib/core/resolve-color-mode.js and the `[data-lattice-slide-bake]` qualifier on all

  // The engine emits no lazy media, but the engine is not the only author of the
  // document: `lib/engine/index.js` sets markdown-it `html: true`, so a deck can carry
  // raw `<img loading="lazy">`. Chromium defers a below-viewport lazy image until AFTER
  // the load event — measured against a 1,500 ms delayed server, `load` returned in 15 ms
  // where `networkidle0` waited 2,014 ms — and every slide after the first is below a
  // 1280x720 viewport. So under `load` alone the fetch never starts and the export ships
  // WITHOUT the image, silently, exit 0: `pdfimages -list` showed the image object present
  // under `networkidle0` and NO image objects at all under `load`.
  //
  // `networkidle0` only ever covered this by accident of timing. Lazy loading is
  // meaningless in a one-shot static export, so this makes it explicit instead: promote
  // every deferred image and frame to eager, then wait for the pixels. Runs after each

  // `.then` was registered before this await: calling `f.load()` on a face that is still
  // `unloaded` switches the FontFaceSet back to loading and REPLACES `document.fonts.ready`
  // with a new promise — measured — at which point the two awaits are on different objects
  // and registration order buys nothing. What actually holds it today is that no face is left
  // `unloaded` when the navigation returns — and the REASON for that changed with the
  // `@font-face` fix at `layoutCSSLinked` above, so the old note here is worth correcting
  // rather than deleting.
  //
  // It used to hold by FAILURE. The document declared 74 faces and settled at 37 `loaded`
  // + 37 `error`: the engine sheet was inlined with its relative `url('fonts/…')` intact,
  // so every one of its faces 404ed off the output directory, PROMPTLY, which is what kept
  // them out of `unloaded`. The note recording that got the composition wrong — it called
  // all 37 errors "KaTeX's relative fonts/…woff2", when only 20 were KaTeX and the other
  // 17 were the engine's own text faces, duplicating the base64 block verbatim.
  //
  // It now holds by RESOLUTION. The doomed duplicates are gone; the document declares 37
  // faces and all 37 load, every one of them local — 17 base64 `data:` in `embeddedFonts`,
  // 20 from the `<link>` to katex.min.css in node_modules. Measured on the same sidecar.
  // That is a stronger footing than prompt failure was, but it is the SAME invariant and it
  // has the SAME hole: a theme or `--css` override adding a genuinely remote face — one that
  // resolves SLOWLY rather than failing or resolving locally — still leaves a face `unloaded`
