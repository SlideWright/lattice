/**
 * lattice-emulator.js — the Lattice CLI: HTML renderer + PDF exporter
 *
 * This is the package's `bin` and `main` (built to dist/lattice-emulator.js).
 * It renders on the OWNED engine (lib/engine/), which is canonical for every
 * first-party render path — this CLI and the browser runtime both interpret it.
 * It emits the section elements, pagination attribute, and header/footer
 * structure that lattice.css targets.
 *
 * The name is historical. The file began as a Marp CLI stand-in during the
 * migration, and the HTML shape it emits stays Marpit-compatible on purpose
 * (that compatibility is what LFM specifies and what Export-to-Marp hands
 * off) — but nothing here defers to Marp, and lattice.css is written for
 * this engine, not for Marp. See engineering/marp-independence.md.
 *
 * Mermaid diagrams (```mermaid blocks) are rendered to SVG via mmdc
 * with theme variables mapped to the Lattice palette.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node lattice-emulator.js <source.md> <output.pdf> [palette]
 *   node lattice-emulator.js <source.md> <custom-layouts.css> <output.pdf> [palette]
 *
 * The bundled `lattice.css` is auto-resolved when no `.css` arg is given;
 * pass an explicit `.css` path only to override the layout engine (rare —
 * for layout-engine development, not deck authoring).
 *
 * Want a copy someone can render with Marp instead? That is a one-way
 * EXPORT, not a render path: `npm run export:marp` (lib/core/marp-bundle.js)
 * produces a self-contained bundle the recipient renders with their own
 * marp-cli. What such a render does and does not reproduce is the ledger in
 * lib/core/marp-fidelity.js.

// reliably in print-to-PDF (different PDF rasterisers honour the soft-mask
// differently: poppler-splash hairlines the group, cairo drops it and shows a
// solid box). So for the PDF we swap each mask span for the mark's actual SVG
// vector, given the marks authored with `fill="currentColor"`: the inline svg
// inherits `color: var(--logo-ink)` (logo-mark-svg rule), so it's the SAME token
// colour as the preview — robust across every PDF viewer. Local marks only;
// remote (http) / already-inlined (data:) srcs are left as the mask span.
// Order-independent: match an empty `<span>` carrying the `logo-mark` class
// anywhere in its attribute run, and pull `--logo-mask` / `aria-label` out of the
// captured attrs — so a future change to the span's attribute order can't silently

USAGE
  node lattice-emulator.js <source.md> <output.pdf|.pptx|.png|.zip|.html> [palette]
  node lattice-emulator.js <source.md> <custom.css> <output> [palette]

ARGUMENTS
  source.md          Markdown source (required)
  output             Output path (required); the extension picks the format:
                       .pdf   vector PDF, selectable text (default; + HTML sidecar;
                              or one image per page with --raster)
                       .pptx  PowerPoint, one full-bleed slide image per slide
                       .png   one PNG per slide, written as <output>.NNN.png
                       .zip   an IMAGE SET — a zip of one raster per slide
                              (PNG/JPEG/WebP) plus opt-in thumbnails and
                              standalone chart/diagram SVGs (see IMAGE SET below)
                       .html  the rendered HTML as the DELIVERABLE — no PDF is
                              written. Still a real browser render (auto-split and
                              the overflow/legibility passes measure laid-out DOM,
                              and this file is their post-split result); it only
                              skips the PDF encode
                     For every format EXCEPT .html, an HTML sidecar is written
                     alongside; with .html that sidecar IS the output file.
  custom.css         Optional layout CSS override; if omitted, the bundled
                     lattice.css from the install dir is used
  palette            Palette name (e.g. 'indaco', 'cuoio')

OPTIONS
  -h, --help              Show this help and exit
  -v, --version           Show version and exit
  -o, --output PATH       Output path (alternative to positional output)
  -p, --palette NAME      Palette name (alternative to positional palette)
  -c, --css PATH          Layout CSS override (alternative to positional custom.css)
  -q, --quiet             Suppress non-error progress output
      --notes             Also write a plaintext speaker-notes sidecar
                          (<output>.notes.txt), one block per slide
      --captions          Also write read-along WebVTT caption sidecars from the
                          speaker notes — one deck-level <output>.vtt (continuous
                          timeline) plus per-slide <output>.NN.vtt. Timing is
                          Cadenza's estimate (no audio, no key); honors --strip-notes
                          and --strip-captions
      --no-split          Do NOT paginate an overflowing slide — render it whole
                          and let it ring. INSTRUMENTATION only: a measurement rig
                          needs page N to stay slide N. A deck that means to show
                          overflow marks the slide <!-- stress-slide --> instead
      --strip-notes       Scrub speaker notes from every output copy (the player
                          DOM, the PDF annotations, AND the embedded source) — a
                          shareable file with no speaker text
      --strip-captions    Scrub the read-as caption channel (inline <!-- caption: -->
                          and front-matter captions:) from the .vtt and embedded
                          source — orthogonal to --strip-notes; those slides fall back
                          to the note / auto projection. NOTE: a slide that had BOTH a
                          caption and a note will now narrate the NOTE — add
                          --strip-notes too if the note is also private
      --notes-icon        Show a clickable sticky-note icon on each slide with
                          a note (default: notes are embedded but hidden)
      --fluid             Emit the .html as the opt-in fluid-box VIEWER: each
                          slide fills the viewport and reflows to portrait on a
                          phone (swipe between slides), with a toggle back to the
                          fixed deck. PDF/PPTX/PNG outputs are unchanged. Can also
                          be enabled per-deck with a 'fluid: true' front-matter key.
      --player            Emit the .html as the self-contained PLAYER: a portable,
                          offline, double-clickable file with three views (Present,
                          Read Slides, Read Article), all assets inlined, the slide
                          HTML sanitized under a strict CSP, and the deck source
                          embedded for lossless re-import. Supersedes --fluid. Can
                          also be enabled with a 'player: true' front-matter key.
      --present           Mark the PDF to open directly in full-screen
                          presentation mode (Adobe Acrobat/Reader and most desktop
                          viewers honour this; browser-embedded viewers ignore it
                          harmlessly). Adds a subtle cross-fade between slides;
                          slides stay presenter-driven (no auto-advance). PDF only.
                          Can also be enabled per-deck with a 'present: true'
                          front-matter key.
      --print             Render in PRINT mode: a B&W-safe, ink-on-white band
                          (grayscale + hatch/dot textures for chart & diagram
                          series) for paper handouts, instead of the screen /
                          colour palette. Every text token clears WCAG AA on
                          white. Any output format; also settable per-deck with
                          'color-mode: print'.
      --raster            Print the PDF as one full-bleed slide image per page
                          (2x JPEG, from the same screenshots the PPTX path
                          takes) instead of vector pages. Maximum viewer
                          compatibility; selectable text is lost. Speaker
                          notes, --present, and --embed-source still apply.
                          PDF only.
      --paper <size>      Fit each slide onto a standard sheet — auto | letter |
                          legal | a4 — instead of the default slide-sized page,
                          so the PDF prints correctly on office paper (baked
                          paper MediaBox, 9mm safe margin, fit + centered, never
                          cropped). auto picks the least-wasteful sheet for the
                          deck's aspect (16:9 → US Legal, 4:3 → Letter). This is
                          a raster paper-fit (like the Studio Print drawer);
                          selectable text is lost. PDF only.
      --orientation <o>   auto | landscape | portrait for --paper (auto follows
                          the deck aspect). Implies --paper auto if given alone.
      --embed-source      Attach the deck's Markdown source to the PDF as an
                          embedded file (visible in any viewer's attachments
                          panel), so the deck can be re-rendered from the PDF
                          alone. Note: ships your source (including speaker
                          notes) inside the artifact.
      --overflow-marker <author|reader|off>
                          Who a clipped slide's marker speaks to in the exported
                          artifact. A slide with more content than fits is CLIPPED
                          (not scrollable, not printed), so the export says so
                          rather than losing it quietly. 'reader' (default) draws a
                          calm "Content clipped" tag; 'author' draws the red ring,
                          the "Overflows" flag and the small-type alarm (the
                          per-cell "Fix Me" tags are preview-only — they need the
                          runtime script an export does not carry); 'off' draws
                          nothing, for a deck you have already
                          checked fits. LATTICE_OVERFLOW_MARKER sets a standing
                          default ('off' is per-render only). The overflow warning
                          on stderr is printed at every level.
      --keep-vector-images
                          Keep SVG images as vectors in the PDF. By default SVG
                          <img>/background images are rasterized to 2x PNG at
                          export, because some PDF viewers (iOS Quartz) mishandle
                          the vector constructs Chromium prints for clipped or
                          cropped SVG placements (#690). Inline SVG (Mermaid,
                          charts, logo marks) always stays vector.

  IMAGE SET (.zip output only)
      --image-format <f>  png (default, lossless, perfect fidelity) | jpeg | webp.
                          jpeg/webp are lossy levers for a smaller set; webp is
                          smaller than jpeg at equal quality.
      --image-size <s>    max (default, fidelity-first: 2x for HD, 1x for 4K) |
                          2x | 1x | half. Lower sizes shrink each image and the
                          overall set — the "size selection" lever.
      --image-quality N   Encoder quality 1–100 for jpeg/webp (default 92);
                          ignored for png.
      --image-mode <m>    Color mode for the whole set — inherit (default, the deck's
                          own / palette-resolved) | light | dark | print. light/dark
                          render the palette's light / dark variant; print is the
                          B&W-safe ink-on-white handout mode.
      --svg-background <b>
                          Look for each standalone chart/diagram SVG —
                          inherit (default) | light | dark | print. Controls BOTH
                          the render and the canvas, independent of --image-mode:
                          light/dark render the chart in that scheme; print renders it
                          B&W-safe (grayscale + textures) on white — so you can export
                          color slides but print-ready chart/diagram vectors.
                          inherit follows the slides' color mode, with no canvas.
      --thumb-width N     Thumbnail width in px (default 480); height follows the
                          slide aspect.
      --no-thumbnails     Omit the thumbnails/ folder (thumbnails ship by default).
      --no-svg            Omit the assets/ folder (standalone chart & diagram SVGs
                          ship by default; each opens on its own, fonts embedded).

  Value-taking options accept both --flag value and --flag=value syntax; the
  boolean switches above take no value. Positional args still work; named
  flags take precedence when both are supplied.

SPEAKER NOTES
  A non-directive HTML comment on a slide is that slide's speaker note
  (Marp-faithful; see spec/LFM-1.0.md). Each note is embedded as a per-page PDF
  text annotation and a hidden HTML presenter-notes channel. By default the PDF
  annotation is hidden — the note is embedded and tool-extractable, but no icon
  marks the slide; --notes-icon exposes a clickable sticky note instead. --notes
  additionally writes a plaintext sidecar. Tooling pragmas (markdownlint /
  prettier) are not notes.

PALETTE RESOLUTION (highest precedence first)
  1. CLI palette positional argument
  2. LATTICE_PALETTE environment variable
  3. Deck front-matter \`theme:\` directive
  4. Default 'indaco'

  Available palettes: ${listAvailablePalettes()}

EXIT CODES
  0  Success

// THE BASE FIRST, THE PALETTE LAST — the order every theme declares (#1527).
//
// A theme opens with `@import 'lattice';`, and in CSS an imported sheet's rules
// come BEFORE the importing sheet's own. That is the whole point of the at-rule,
// and it is the only reason a theme can override the base at all.
// `loadPaletteWithImports` skips that import (the base is not on the theme
// search path), so this line is where the relationship is re-established — and
// until now it re-established it BACKWARDS, appending the base after the theme
// so `base.tokens.css`'s plain `:root` block landed later at equal specificity
// and won. 925 declarations across 37 distinct tokens were dead on this path,
// on all 32 selectable themes (measured today; the 2026-08-10 note's 932 across
// 36 was the same corpus six days earlier). `--hljs-*`, the `--diagram-*` state
// family and `--seq-500` are the curated families that never painted, which is
// why concrete and onyx shipped hand-solved ramp anchors no PDF had ever
// rendered.
// NOT `--cat-N-ink`: the base declares no `:root` default for that tier, so
// nothing competed with a palette's value in either order and it was never dead
// here. Its exemption's JUSTIFICATION is what this line retires, not the tier.
//
// The other three sites that order these two stylesheets already agreed with the
// themes: the Mermaid var reader below (which cites this same `@import`
// rationale in as many words), `engine.addThemes` further down, and
// `lib/engine/css.js`'s `composeCss`, which inlines the base at the theme's own
// `@import` position — so the Studio, the docs Playground and the browser
// playground have always rendered the palette's value. Measured on the real
// engine on 2026-08-11, against that day's corpus: 932 of 932 disputed tokens
// resolved there exactly as this line now does, and none as it used to. This
// makes the export agree with the preview rather than swapping which one is
// wrong.
//
// ONE CONSEQUENCE ON THE PUBLIC CLI, called out because the reasoning above does
// not cover it. `--css` / `-c` (and the positional form) name a CALLER-SUPPLIED
// layout sheet, and the `@import 'lattice'` argument is about the BUNDLED base —
// a theme's import still refers to the bundled sheet, not to the caller's. This
// file already knows that: `engine.addThemes` registers a custom layout sheet
// ANONYMOUSLY for exactly that reason. So a `:root` override in a hand-passed
// stylesheet used to win and now loses to the theme. That is a behavior change on
// a documented surface, it is in the changelog as breaking, and the answer for a
// caller who wants to override tokens is a theme rather than a layout sheet.
//
// There is no selector that wins in BOTH orders, which is what made this a
// concat change rather than a specificity one: `:where(:root)` on the base's
// defaults renders correctly here and is unusable, because Marpit's
// root-replacement only fires for a BARE `:root` and a wrapped block is scoped
// as a section inside a section, undefined on the engine path.
// `:root:root` in the palette fails symmetrically.
// See engineering/decisions/2026-08-10-palette-concat-order.md,

// "read `size:`", and they did not agree. Two divergences were real, both found by adversarial
// review on #1234, and both landed on the SPLIT GATE — which decides its answer from the deck's
// geometry, so a reader that mis-reads `size:` sends the gate to the wrong box:
//
//   · CRLF. Two copies matched `/^---\n/`, LF only, while `lib/authoring/lint-core.js` and two
//     other readers in THIS file already used `\r?\n`. A deck saved with CRLF line endings has
//     front matter that the marpit engine parses fine — so the engine stamped `data-family="tall"`
//     for `size: story` while this file saw NO front matter at all, defaulted to `hd`, and
//     rendered tall-family CSS into a 1280x720 landscape page with the content clipped. Every
//     other directive (`theme:`, `color-mode:`, `style:`, `fluid:`) was silently dropped with it.
//   · A trailing YAML comment. `size: story # phone` is legal YAML and the value is `story`, but
//     a `$`-anchored value pattern rejects the whole line and falls back to `hd`, while lint's
//     prefix-matching copy accepted it — so lint promised a split the engine would not perform.
//
// `\r?\n` on both sides, and the value pattern tolerates the comment and the `.` that lint has
// always allowed. Strictly a superset of what these matched before: no LF deck changes.

// ── Mermaid renderer ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Two surfaces wire the rendered SVG to the active palette:
//
//   1. themeVariables.  Mermaid inlines a handful of values into the SVG
//      as attributes (gradient stops, gantt grid lines, marker fills).
//      CSS can't reach those — they must come from this map. The map below
//      is structural metadata; values come from the active palette's
//      --diagram-* / --cat-* / --text-* tokens.
//
//   2. lattice.css "DIAGRAM OVERRIDES" section.  Per-diagram CSS
//      (`section .section-N rect { fill: var(--cat-3-fill) }` and so
//      on) that target classes Mermaid emits but doesn't theme. Loaded as
//      a normal page stylesheet via lattice.css; the mmdc-produced SVG is
//      embedded inline in the host HTML, so the host stylesheet cascades
//      onto it at PDF-rasterize time — same mechanism the runtime preview
//      already uses. No Mermaid `themeCSS` init parameter is used.
//
// See engineering/decisions/2026-05-12-diagram-tokens.md for the architecture.

// slots but 38 different VALUES. They are now one object, so a key exists on both
// paths or on neither, and there is one set of values.
//
// The map names which Mermaid theme variable corresponds to which CSS custom
// property in the active palette. The CSS variables hold the actual hex values;
// the map is structural and unchanging across palettes, so adding a palette
// means declaring the same custom properties in themes/<n>.css — never editing
// the map.
//
// The `%%{init}%%` reconciliation kernel (#1311) — how the engine palette and an
// author's own directive coexist, shared with the runtime (HARD RULE #1).

 * render — 92%, and the largest single cost anywhere in the CLI
 * (engineering/decisions/2026-08-16-render-format-cost-assessment.md §2b).

 * two fences up.
 *

// overflowing its box, and the slide has a seam (lib/core/auto-split.js `resplitDoc`, driven
// by the `measureOverflow` evaluate below). The capacity map is hoisted to module scope so
// the measured loop can read each layout's split AXIS + pacing from the top-level `capacity`
// OR the per-family `adapt.capacity`, so a layout whose budget lives only in adapt is still
// splittable. See engineering/decisions/2026-06-22-the-fit-spine.md §3.
//
// SPLIT FIRES ON FIT, NEVER ON COUNT (2026-07-29). There used to be a second trigger: a cheap
// pre-render pass counted the collection against `capacity.hard` and fed every over-budget
// slide into the measured loop as a candidate, so a slide that was authored past its budget
// AND fit its box comfortably was cut anyway — twelve one-line checklist items at
// `size: portrait`, occupying about a third of the canvas, became three pages, two of them
// mostly white. That is the engine second-guessing an author who
// stayed inside the geometry. `capacity` is an AUTHORING advisory and `lint:deck` is where it
// speaks; the engine's only question is "does it fit". See
// engineering/decisions/2026-07-29-autosplit-is-not-a-toggle.md §"Fit, not count".

// COUNT is a function of the content and the box, not an authoring fact — which is why the

// `--no-split` is INSTRUMENTATION, not authoring: the measurement rigs need page N to
// stay slide N so they can measure (tools/check-family-tiers.js's sweep records the

// composed. Pagination at wide would be the engine re-cutting a deck to solve a problem the
// author does not have. The sizes that DO need it are the ones the deck was never authored
// for — `square`, `portrait`, `story`, `mobile` — where the same content meets a box it was
// never fitted to and the choice is paginate or clip.
//
// One classifier, the same one the components read off `data-family` (lib/adaptive/families.js):
// square → square, portrait|story → tall, mobile → strip, hd|4K|16:9|standard → wide. Naming the

// through every band and returns 'strip' — the opposite verdict from the 'wide' those two produce

// `data-lattice-slide` — which engineSlides() stamps AFTER engine.render — so the
// engine's own logo pass no-ops and the emulator runs it here, post-stamp." The first
// half was true and was the bug: keying on an attribute `lib/engine` never writes made
// the injector dead on the canonical render path, so `logo:` produced nothing in the
// Studio, the playground and every live preview. The engine's pass selects slides with
// the shared section walker now, so it does the work inside engine.render — and this
// second pass became a DUPLICATE. It was not a harmless one: `applyBackdropToHtml` puts
// the finish wrapper ahead of the mark, so the re-run's first-child guard missed and
// stacked a second logo on every finish slide of a logo deck.
//
// One injector, one call site. Nothing to re-run post-stamp, because nothing in the

// DELETE the reconciliation devices, not accumulate more."
//
// What it did: the texture polarity pins in themes/{onyx,concrete,a11y-base}.css are
// valid exactly where a diagram's ink is baked PER SLIDE, and this attribute was what
// said so. It had to exist because the two render paths disagreed about granularity —
// this one baked per slide, the runtime baked ONCE from the first section — so the
// pins were right here and wrong there. Pinned live on a runtime path, a
// `_class: dark` slide got a dark chip under slide-1's dark ink: 1.55:1 in a real
// marp-cli render, where before it was 17.14:1.
//
// #1332 step 3 ended the disagreement: the runtime now resolves its palette from the
// section it is rendering. Both paths bake per slide, the pins are unconditionally
// correct, and an attribute that announces "this render baked per slide" announces
// nothing. Deleted, along with `SLIDE_BAKE_ATTR`/`stampSlideBake` in
// lib/core/resolve-color-mode.js and the `[data-lattice-slide-bake]` qualifier on all
// nine pinned selectors.
//
// ONE case still needs the pins to stand down, and `:not(.print)` on every pin is now
// sufficient for it: `--print` bakes one B&W band deck-wide, and `print` reaches EVERY
// section — including one that pins its own `_class: dark`, which used to evict it
// (lib/core/color-mode.js `slidePinEvictsDeckToken`). That eviction was the seam the

  // private NOTE channel; a caption is public-facing narration the author opts into via `--captions`.
  // Front-matter `captions:[n]` is keyed by AUTHORED slide, and splitting changes the
  // page count — so the keys stop lining up the moment a slide paginates. This used to
  // DROP the whole map on any split deck, which was survivable while splitting was
  // opt-in and is not now that it is intrinsic: every deck with a split slide would
  // silently lose its authored captions. Remap instead. `authoredIndexPerPage` recovers
  // page → authored slide from the contiguous `data-split-run` groups, so a caption
  // written for slide 4 reaches every page slide 4 became — the same treatment notes
  // got, for the same reason (2026-07-29-autosplit-is-not-a-toggle.md).
